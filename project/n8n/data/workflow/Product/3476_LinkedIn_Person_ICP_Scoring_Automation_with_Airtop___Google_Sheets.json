  "readme": "### About The ICP Person Scoring Automation\n\nSorting through lists of potential leads manually to determine who's truly worth your sales team's time isn't just tedious, it's incredibly inefficient. Without proper qualification, your team might spend hours pursuing prospects who aren't the right fit for your product, while ideal customers slip through the cracks.\n\n### How to Automate Identifying Your Ideal Customers\n\nWith this automation, you'll learn how to automatically score and prioritize leads using data extracted directly from LinkedIn profiles via Airtop's built-in integration with n8n. By the end, you'll have a fully automated workflow that analyzes prospects and calculates an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) score, helping your sales team focus on high-potential opportunities.\n\n### What You'll Need\n\n  * A free [Airtop API key](https://portal.airtop.ai/?utm_campaign=n8n)\n  * A copy of [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O69nQkKr4fyWl5AQUrX7y-nwPCMDeFwp-2swG0YW6Cg/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheets\n\n\n\n### Understanding the Process\n\nThis automation transforms how you qualify and prioritize leads by extracting real-time, accurate information directly from LinkedIn profiles. Unlike static databases that quickly become outdated, this workflow taps into the most current professional information available.\n\nThe workflow in this template:\n\n  * Uses Airtop to extract comprehensive LinkedIn profile data\n  * Analyzes the data to calculate an ICP score based on AI interest, technical depth, and seniority\n  * Updates your Google Sheet with the enriched data and the ICP score\n\n\n\n### Person ICP Scoring Workflow\n\nOur person-focused workflow evaluates individual LinkedIn profiles to determine how well they match your ideal customer profile by:\n\n  * Extracting data for each individual\n  * Analyzing their profile to determine seniority and technical depth\n\n\n\nThe system then automatically calculates an ICP score based on the following criteria:\n\n  * AI Interest: beginner-5 pts, intermediate-10 pts, advanced-25 pts, expert-35 pts\n  * Technical Depth: basic-5 pts, intermediate-15 pts, advanced-25 pts, expert-35 pts\n  * Seniority Level: junior-5 pts, mid-level-15 pts, senior-25 pts, executive-30 pts\n\n\n\n### Setting Up Your Automation\n\nHere's how to get started:\n\n#### Configure your connections\n\n  * Connect your Google Sheets account\n  * Add your Airtop API key (obtain from the [Airtop dashboard](https://portal.airtop.ai/api-keys))\n\n\n\n#### Set up your Google Sheet\n\n  * Ensure your Google Sheet has the necessary columns for input data and result fields\n  * Ensure that columns Linkedin_URL_Person and ICP_Score_Person exist at least\n\n\n\n#### Configure the Airtop module\n\n  * Set up the Airtop module to use the appropriate LinkedIn extraction prompt\n  * Use our provided prompt that extracts individual profile data\n\n\n\n### Customization Options\n\nWhile our templates work out of the box, you might want to customize them for your specific needs:\n\n  * Modify the ICP scoring criteria: Adjust the point values or add additional criteria specific to your business\n  * Add notification triggers: Set up Slack or email notifications for high-value leads that exceed a certain ICP threshold\n  * Implement batch processing: Modify the workflow to process leads in batches to optimize performance\n  * Add conditional logic: Create different scoring models for different industries or product lines\n  * Integrate with your CRM: Integrate this automation with your preferred CRM to get the details added automatically for you\n\n\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nHere's how businesses are using this automation:\n\n**AI Sales Platform** : A B2B AI company could implement this workflow to process their trade show lead list of contacts. Within hours, they can identify the top 50 prospects based on ICP score.\n\n**SaaS Analytics Tool** : A SaaS company could implement LinkedIn enrichment to identify which companies fit best. The automation processes weekly leads and categorizes them into high, medium, and low priority tiers, allowing their sales team to focus on the most promising opportunities first.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nTo get the most out of this automation:\n\n  * Review and refine your ICP criteria quarterly: What constitutes an ideal customer may evolve as your product and market develop\n  * Create tiered follow-up processes: Develop different outreach strategies based on ICP score ranges\n  * Perform regular data validation: Periodically check the accuracy of the automated scoring against your actual sales results\n\n\n\n### What's Next?\n\nNow that you've automated your ICP scoring with LinkedIn data, you might be interested in:\n\n  * Setting up automated outreach sequences based on ICP score thresholds\n  * Creating custom reporting dashboards to track conversion rates by ICP segment\n  * Expanding your scoring model to include additional data sources\n  * Implementing lead assignment automation based on ICP scores\n\n\n\nHappy automating!\n",
