There is another way however - using n8n and AI! N8N offers an end-to-end solution to parse XLSX form attachments using LLM-powered OCR and send the extracted output to your ERP or otherwise.\n\n### How it works\n\n  * An Outlook trigger is used to watch for incoming purchase order forms submitted via a shared inbox.\n  * The email attachment for the submission is a form in xlsx format - like this one [Purchase Order Example](https://1drv.ms/x/c/8f1f7dda12b7a145/ETWH8dKwgZ1OiVz7ISUWYf8BwiyihBjXPXEbCYkVi8XDyw?e=WWU2eR) \\- which is imported into the workflow.\n  * The 'Extract from File' node is used with the 'code' node to convert the xlsx file to markdown. This is so our LLM can understand it.\n  * The Information Extractor node is used to read and extract the relevant purchase order details and line items from the form.\n  * A simple validation step is used to check for common errors such as missing PO number or the amounts not matching up. A notification is automated to reply to the buyer if so.\n  * Once validation passes, a confirmation is sent to the buyer and the purchase order structured output can be sent along to internal systems.\n\n\n\n### How to use\n\n  * This template only works if you're expecting and receiving forms in XLSX format. These can be invoices, request forms as well as purchase order forms.\n  * Update the Outlook nodes with your email or other emails as required.\n  * What's next? I've omitted the last steps to send to an ERP or accounting system as this is dependent on your org.\n\n\n\n### Requirements\n\n  * Outlook for Emails \n    * Check out how to setup credentials here: [https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft/)\n  * OpenAI for LLM document understanding and extraction.\n\n\n\n### Customising the workflow\n\n  * This template should work for other Excel files. Some will be more complicated than others so experiment with different parsers and extraction tools and strategies.\n  * Customise the Information Extractor Schema to pull out the specific data you need. For example, capture any notes or comments given by the buyer.\n\n\n",
