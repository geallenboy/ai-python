This is so our LLM can understand it.\n  * The Information Extractor node is used to read and extract the relevant purchase order details and line items from the form.\n  * A simple validation step is used to check for common errors such as missing PO number or the amounts not matching up. A notification is automated to reply to the buyer if so.\n  * Once validation passes, a confirmation is sent to the buyer and the purchase order structured output can be sent along to internal systems.\n\n\n\n### How to use\n\n  * This template only works if you're expecting and receiving forms in XLSX format. These can be invoices, request forms as well as purchase order forms.\n  * Update the Outlook nodes with your email or other emails as required.\n  * What's next? I've omitted the last steps to send to an ERP or accounting system as this is dependent on your org.\n\n\n\n### Requirements\n\n  * Outlook for Emails \n    * Check out how to setup credentials here: [https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft/)\n  * OpenAI for LLM document understanding and extraction.\n\n\n\n### Customising the workflow\n\n  * This template should work for other Excel files. Some will be more complicated than others so experiment with different parsers and extraction tools and strategies.\n  * Customise the Information Extractor Schema to pull out the specific data you need. For example, capture any notes or comments given by the buyer.\n\n\n",

  "readme_zh": "### 该n8n模板可自动从Outlook导入采购订单提交文件，并将XLSX格式的采购订单附件转换为结构化数据\n\n处理用户提交的XLSX表格数据录入工作既耗时又枯燥，但这类继承性任务往往对业务运营至关重要。虽然我们渴望系统革新，但变革实属不易。不过还有另一种解决方案——利用n8n和AI技术！通过结合LLM光学字符识别技术，n8n提供端到端解决方案来解析XLSX附件，并将提取的数据发送至ERP等系统。\n\n### 运作原理\n• 通过Outlook触发器监控共享收件箱的采购订单提交邮件  \n• 提取邮件中的XLSX格式表单附件（示例文件可见[采购订单模板](https://1drv.ms/x/c/8f1f7dda12b7a145/ETWH8dKwgZ1OiVz7ISUWYf8BwiyihBjXPXEbCYkVi8XDyw?e=WWU2eR)）  \n• 使用\"文件提取\"节点配合\"代码\"节点将XLSX转为Markdown格式以供LLM解析  \n• 通过信息提取节点读取采购订单明细及行项目数据  \n• 基础验证步骤会检查常见错误（如缺失采购单号或金额不符），发现问题将自动回复通知采购方  \n• 验证通过后向采购方发送确认函，结构化采购订单数据即可传输至内部系统  \n\n### 使用说明\n• 本模板仅适用于XLSX格式文件（包括发票、申请单等）处理  \n• 根据需求修改Outlook节点配置的邮箱地址  \n• 最后一步未设置ERP/财务系统对接功能，需根据组织架构自行配置  \n\n### 系统要求\n• Outlook邮件账户  \n  凭证设置指南：[微软凭证配置文档](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft/)  \n• OpenAI服务（用于LLM文档解析与数据提取）  \n\n### 工作流定制\n• 模板兼容其他Excel文件（复杂文件需测试不同解析策略）  \n• 可自定义信息提取架构以捕获特定数据（如采购方备注信息）",
