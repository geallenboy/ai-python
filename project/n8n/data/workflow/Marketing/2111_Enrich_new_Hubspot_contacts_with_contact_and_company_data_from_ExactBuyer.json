Once active, this n8n workflow will update the social profiles, contact data (phone, email) as well as location data from ExactBuyer.\n\n## Setup\n\n  1. Add HubSpot trigger credential (be careful, scopes must be exactly as in [n8n docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/hubspot/) )\n  2. Add your Exact Buyer API key\n  3. Add HubSpot credential for update node (be careful, scopes must be same as [n8n docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/hubspot/) for this. This is different from the trigger cred)\n  4. Activate workflow\n\n\n\n## How to adjust this template\n\nThere's plenty of interesting info that ExactBuyer returns that could be helpful. Take a look and update this workflow to add what you need.\n",
