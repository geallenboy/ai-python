However, to get unlimited Applets (the term given to one instance of connecting two apps), you’ll need the Pro+ plan. </p><h3 id=\"is-ifttt-still-good\">Is IFTTT still good?<br></h3><p>Despite the workflow options IFTTT provides, let’s see why customers are on the lookout for alternatives. </p><p>Some users feel that IFTTT doesn’t cater to developers or where <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/products/ifttt/reviews?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">heavier customization is needed</a>. Here’s what they had to say in their reviews on <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">G2</a>:</p><p><em>“I wish there was a more developer-centric interface available for general advanced users to be able to create custom formulas and actions beyond what has already been provided.”</em></p><p><em>“IFTTT is capable to do almost every task by itself yet it is restricted to only those actions which do not require an intelligent quotient. If one wants to create an applet that requires multiple dependencies, can not be created with IFTTT as it is limited to performing the actions that require just one dependency.”</em></p><p>A common thread through the more critical reviews is that while great for personal use, IFTTT is <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/products/ifttt/reviews?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">less suited to business use cases</a>. Here are the views of others in their G2 reviews: </p><p><em>“For the most part, business integration is its downfall.”</em></p><p><em>“If you're looking for something for automating business processes that has a more robust offering of integrated programs than Gmail and to-do lists, this may not be the right automation tool for you.”</em></p><p>Elsewhere, customers have been discussing IFTTT competitors on Reddit due to the free version <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/vge8jz/i_was_excited_to_try_ifttt_when_i_realized_almost/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offering little practical functionality</a> and the plan upgrade needed for multi-action Applets:</p><p><em>“I was excited to try IFTTT when I realized almost everything requires the paid version.

id=\"what-are-ifttt-open-source-alternatives\">What are IFTTT open-source alternatives?</h3><p>Apache Airflow — a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

As we saw in the earlier reviews, to get real value out of the software, you’ll really need to upgrade to a paid plan.</p><p>One IFTTT free alternative to consider is n8n, which offers <a href=\"https://n8n.io/pricing/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free self-hosted and desktop options</a>. Or, you can start with the<a href=\"https://n8n.io/cloud/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> free trial for the cloud app</a>, and n8n take care of the hosting, security, and maintenance of your n8n instance.</p><h3 id=\"is-there-a-better-app-than-ifttt\">Is there a better app than IFTTT?</h3><p>As we’ve seen based on our comparison, it really depends on your circumstances, budget and aspirations. </p><p>If you’d get value out of a desktop app, the ability to create your own nodes and free community support, then n8n is the right IFTTT replacement for you. </p><h3 id=\"which-is-better-%E2%80%94-zapier-or-ifttt\">Which is better — Zapier or IFTTT?</h3><p>This is a commonly searched question for individuals and businesses looking for the best workflow integration platform. </p><p>However, with Zapier, there’s a limited selection of integrations, and you pay more the more tasks you have. </p><p>As we’ve seen, IFTTT isn’t best suited to business use cases and offers little through its free forever plan. </p><h2 id=\"wrap-up\">Wrap up</h2><p>If you’ve been considering a move to an IFTTT alternative, you’re not short of options to help automate your business processes. </p><p>If you want to start for free before committing to any tool, consider starting with <a href=\"https://app.n8n.cloud/register?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">n8n free trial.</a></p><p>n8n doesn’t charge extra for running more advanced workflows with multiple nodes or how much data you exchange.

  "readme": "Millions of customers have turned to IFTTT to streamline their lives and upgrade how they perform day-to-day activities. \n\nA quick glance at the IFTTT homepage gives you a flavour of how you can connect apps and live smarter. Whether you want to automatically [turn your home lights on at sunset](https://ifttt.com/applets/PVkgiLYy-automatically-turn-your-lights-on-at-sunset?ref=blog.n8n.io), or [save your favorite tweets in an Evernote notebook](https://ifttt.com/applets/uEU2WQtR-save-your-favorite-tweets-in-an-evernote-notebook?ref=blog.n8n.io), IFTTT’s got you covered. \n\nBut while IFTTT might make you the automation wizard among your friends, it’s not for everyone — or every business. The main downsides of IFTTT are that:\n\n  * It’s not geared to SMB or enterprise-level business use cases.\n  * You’ll get little practical use out of the free version, so will almost definitely need to upgrade and pay more.\n  * You’re limited in terms of what actions and triggers you can choose — especially when compared to competing platforms.\n\n\n\nThis is why many are searching for IFTTT alternatives. In this article, we’ll explore some of these alternatives that _do_ cover IFTTT’s main imperfections.  \n\nWithout further ado, let’s get into it!\n\n## The 13 best IFTTT alternatives\n\n![IFTTT Alternatives](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/11/ifttt-chart.jpg)IFTTT Alternatives\n\nThe diagram above outlines the platforms we’ll be discussing.\n\nAs you can see, there are different options depending on your coding experience and business size. If you’re new to the world of workflow automation, then you can quickly check which platform suits your technical experience and circumstances. \n\nIf you know which IFTTT replacement you’d like more information on, jump straight in by clicking below:\n\n  1. n8n\n  2. Levity\n  3. Cyclr\n  4. Pipedream\n  5. Zapier\n  6. Unito\n  7. Make\n  8. Tray\n  9. Mulesoft\n  10. Workato\n  11. Microsoft Power Automate\n  12. Kissflow\n  13. Airbyte  \n\n\n\n\n## A closer look at IFTTT\n\nBefore we explore the best IFTTT alternatives, let’s see exactly what IFTTT _does_ offer:\n\n**Overview** : [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io) is a connectivity platform that allows you to customize and control your integrations with filter code, queries, multiple actions, and the ability to connect multiple accounts per service.  \n\n![IFTTT overview](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/11/if-1.png)IFTTT overview\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * Offers connectivity options for home automation, which many other platforms don’t. These include smart lights, thermostats, coffee machines and dishwashers.\n  * Pre-built Applets offer purpose-built workflows to connect apps and services, no matter how disparate they may seem.\n\n\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * If you need to create a custom Applet, the review process takes much longer than with other platforms.\n  * You’ll struggle to get much insight from the free plan. For a meaningful experience, you’ll need to upgrade and face the associated costs. \n\n\n\n**Pricing** : Free plan (€0), Pro (€2.60/month) and Pro+ (€5.20/month). However, to get unlimited Applets (the term given to one instance of connecting two apps), you’ll need the Pro+ plan. \n\n### Is IFTTT still good?  \n\n\nDespite the workflow options IFTTT provides, let’s see why customers are on the lookout for alternatives. \n\nSome users feel that IFTTT doesn’t cater to developers or where [heavier customization is needed](https://www.g2.com/products/ifttt/reviews?ref=blog.n8n.io). Here’s what they had to say in their reviews on [G2](https://www.g2.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io):\n\n_“I wish there was a more developer-centric interface available for general advanced users to be able to create custom formulas and actions beyond what has already been provided.”_\n\n _“IFTTT is capable to do almost every task by itself yet it is restricted to only those actions which do not require an intelligent quotient. If one wants to create an applet that requires multiple dependencies, can not be created with IFTTT as it is limited to performing the actions that require just one dependency.”_\n\nA common thread through the more critical reviews is that while great for personal use, IFTTT is [less suited to business use cases](https://www.g2.com/products/ifttt/reviews?ref=blog.n8n.io). Here are the views of others in their G2 reviews: \n\n_“For the most part, business integration is its downfall.”_\n\n _“If you're looking for something for automating business processes that has a more robust offering of integrated programs than Gmail and to-do lists, this may not be the right automation tool for you.”_\n\nElsewhere, customers have been discussing IFTTT competitors on Reddit due to the free version [offering little practical functionality](https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/vge8jz/i_was_excited_to_try_ifttt_when_i_realized_almost/?ref=blog.n8n.io) and the plan upgrade needed for multi-action Applets:\n\n_“I was excited to try IFTTT when I realized almost everything requires the paid version. What are the good alternatives?”_\n\nAnd even on an [IFTTT subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ifttt/comments/ixy5ke/ifttt_alternatives_if_you_cant_afford_to_pay/?ref=blog.n8n.io), the question of IFTTT free alternatives is a big topic of discussion, showing the clear hunger to move to new platforms.\n\n## 13 IFTTT alternatives\n\n### n8n\n\n**Best for:** Advanced branched workflows\n\n![IFTTT Alternatives: n8n](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/11/n8n-1.png)IFTTT Alternatives: n8n\n\n**Overview:**[n8n](http://n8n.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io) is a free, source-available, and self-hostable workflow automation tool that lets you connect anything to everything with [native integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/?ref=blog.n8n.io) or [build your own nodes.](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n\n**Pros and cons compared to IFTTT:**\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Unlike IFTTT, n8n doesn’t charge extra for running more advanced workflows with multiple nodes or how much data you exchange.\n  * [Represent complex logic in your workflows](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/?ref=blog.n8n.io) through merging, looping, and error handling.\n  * Write your own JavaScript code to [do almost anything](https://n8n.io/limitless-integrations/?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n  * Can be hosted on your servers.\n\n\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Offers more features and functionality than IFTTT, which means it may take more time to understand and implement (though there is documentation, tutorials and a user-friendly interface to help you).\n\n\n\n**Pricing:**[Free self-hosted and desktop options](https://n8n.io/pricing/?ref=blog.n8n.io) and cloud packages start at €20 per month for 5,000 workflow executions.\n\n### Levity\n\n**Best for:** Artificial intelligence and machine learning-powered workflows\n\n![IFTTT Alternatives: Levity](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/11/levity.png)IFTTT Alternatives: Levity\n\n**Overview:** Levity offers simple but powerful AI for documents, images, and text, that automates your daily repetitive tasks.

schedule, and monitor workflows. Requires technical knowledge, so suitable for coders.\n\nBigBI — a drag & drop ETL with the full benefits of Apache Spark™.\n\nCadence — a leading EDA and Intelligent System Design provider delivering hardware, software, and IP for electronic design.\n\n[n8n](https://n8n.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io) — a workflow automation tool that is not open source, but it is [source available](https://blog.n8n.io/fair-code-for-sustainable-open-source-alternatives/).\n\n### Is there a free version of IFTTT?\n\nYes, there’s a free forever plan, but it doesn’t include multi-applet Applets — you’ll need to upgrade to access these. As we saw in the earlier reviews, to get real value out of the software, you’ll really need to upgrade to a paid plan.\n\nOne IFTTT free alternative to consider is n8n, which offers [free self-hosted and desktop options](https://n8n.io/pricing/?ref=blog.n8n.io). Or, you can start with the[ free trial for the cloud app](https://n8n.io/cloud/?ref=blog.n8n.io), and n8n take care of the hosting, security, and maintenance of your n8n instance.\n\n### Is there a better app than IFTTT?\n\nAs we’ve seen based on our comparison, it really depends on your circumstances, budget and aspirations. \n\nIf you’d get value out of a desktop app, the ability to create your own nodes and free community support, then n8n is the right IFTTT replacement for you. \n\n### Which is better — Zapier or IFTTT?\n\nThis is a commonly searched question for individuals and businesses looking for the best workflow integration platform. \n\nHowever, with Zapier, there’s a limited selection of integrations, and you pay more the more tasks you have. \n\nAs we’ve seen, IFTTT isn’t best suited to business use cases and offers little through its free forever plan. \n\n## Wrap up\n\nIf you’ve been considering a move to an IFTTT alternative, you’re not short of options to help automate your business processes. \n\nIf you want to start for free before committing to any tool, consider starting with [n8n free trial.](https://app.n8n.cloud/register?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n\nn8n doesn’t charge extra for running more advanced workflows with multiple nodes or how much data you exchange.
