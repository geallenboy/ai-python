By keeping your AI setup local, you avoid the unpredictable expenses of API calls to external models.

Plus, you won’t have to worry about your data leaving your control—everything stays on your terms, in your environment.</p><p>We’re local AI enthusiasts ourselves, but we understand the challenges of this approach – it’s hard to get started, and even harder to maintain.
