  "html": "<p>Looking for Zapier alternatives?</p><p>We totally understand the struggle – with a focus on purely transactional tasks, limited custom API requests, and a moderate level of Zap flexibility, users may need to look for a more robust platform.</p><p>In this article, we delve into an in-depth comparison of the 9 best Zapier alternatives. To conduct our research thoroughly, we:</p><ul><li>combined 9 tools in 3 groups: workflow automation tools, Zapier's direct competitors, and enterprise automation platforms;</li><li>systematically evaluated each tool according to the same criteria. Yes, we checked a total of 500 checkboxes for each alternative and of course Zapier;</li><li>created a summary for each tool compared to Zapier, highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses.</li></ul><p>Join us as we walk you through our research and comparison process, explaining why we recommend these 9 Zapier alternatives!</p><h2 id=\"is-zapier-the-best-automation-tool\">Is Zapier the best automation tool?</h2><p>Zapier is among the top automation tools due to its user-friendly interface, extensive integration options, and robust features for streamlining workflows.</p><p>After evaluating 9 platforms in this article, Zapier stood out for its simplicity and accessibility. It is also known for solid documentation and quality support from the company itself, the community, and outside experts.</p><p>However, when comparing Zapier to our expectations for a robust automation platform, it might not have all the features you're seeking. And Zapier's weakest point is, of course, the pricing model. We’ve only provided nominal fee ratings, regardless of the value proposition of each tool.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">💡</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">Here we’ve analyzed <a href=\"https://n8n.io/vs/zapier/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zapier’s pricing model against n8n</a>, a source-available workflow automation tool, to illustrate the contrast between task-based and execution-based pricing models.</div></div><p>Here's what you need to know about Zapier's pricing and feature limitations in a nutshell:</p><ul><li><strong>Feature gating: </strong>while Zapier can handle basic branching and filtering, these steps are not available on a free tier. Many other features are only available on higher tiers, such as IF conditions, custom error notifications, premium apps, workflow sharing, and more.</li><li>In addition, <strong>Zapier multiplies each step by the number of records in the data.</strong> This means that processing a table with 10 records in a most simple 2-step Zap would require 10 steps (the trigger step is free + the second step runs 10 times).</li><li><strong>The prices for Zapier are difficult to estimate in advance.</strong> The service charges for almost every step in a Zap (except the first trigger step and some internal steps such as Filter, Formatter, and Branching). </li></ul><p>Take a look at the screenshot below.</p><p>Creating such a small workflow on n8n typically needs about 20 individual Zaps if you make them with simple 2-step Zaps. Even if you manage to build a multi-step workflow on paid tiers, all Zaps are limited to a single trigger. Adding multiple triggers to the same workflow quickly racks up the overall project complexity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img

The only downside is the completely obscure pricing.

  "readme": "Looking for Zapier alternatives?\n\nWe totally understand the struggle – with a focus on purely transactional tasks, limited custom API requests, and a moderate level of Zap flexibility, users may need to look for a more robust platform.\n\nIn this article, we delve into an in-depth comparison of the 9 best Zapier alternatives. To conduct our research thoroughly, we:\n\n  * combined 9 tools in 3 groups: workflow automation tools, Zapier's direct competitors, and enterprise automation platforms;\n  * systematically evaluated each tool according to the same criteria. Yes, we checked a total of 500 checkboxes for each alternative and of course Zapier;\n  * created a summary for each tool compared to Zapier, highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\n\nJoin us as we walk you through our research and comparison process, explaining why we recommend these 9 Zapier alternatives!\n\n## Is Zapier the best automation tool?\n\nZapier is among the top automation tools due to its user-friendly interface, extensive integration options, and robust features for streamlining workflows.\n\nAfter evaluating 9 platforms in this article, Zapier stood out for its simplicity and accessibility. It is also known for solid documentation and quality support from the company itself, the community, and outside experts.\n\nHowever, when comparing Zapier to our expectations for a robust automation platform, it might not have all the features you're seeking. And Zapier's weakest point is, of course, the pricing model. We’ve only provided nominal fee ratings, regardless of the value proposition of each tool.\n\n💡\n\nHere we’ve analyzed [Zapier’s pricing model against n8n](https://n8n.io/vs/zapier/?ref=blog.n8n.io), a source-available workflow automation tool, to illustrate the contrast between task-based and execution-based pricing models.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Zapier's pricing and feature limitations in a nutshell:\n\n  * **Feature gating:** while Zapier can handle basic branching and filtering, these steps are not available on a free tier. Many other features are only available on higher tiers, such as IF conditions, custom error notifications, premium apps, workflow sharing, and more.\n  * In addition, **Zapier multiplies each step by the number of records in the data.** This means that processing a table with 10 records in a most simple 2-step Zap would require 10 steps (the trigger step is free + the second step runs 10 times).\n  * **The prices for Zapier are difficult to estimate in advance.** The service charges for almost every step in a Zap (except the first trigger step and some internal steps such as Filter, Formatter, and Branching). \n\n\n\nTake a look at the screenshot below.\n\nCreating such a small workflow on n8n typically needs about 20 individual Zaps if you make them with simple 2-step Zaps. Even if you manage to build a multi-step workflow on paid tiers, all Zaps are limited to a single trigger. Adding multiple triggers to the same workflow quickly racks up the overall project complexity.\n\n![Zapier’s pricing model against n8n](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2024/02/zapier_n8n_2_98617837ef-1-.png)Zapier’s pricing model against n8n\n\n## What is the best Zapier alternative?\n\nWe’ve selected 9 best Zapier alternatives and divided them into 3 main groups:\n\n  1. Workflow automation tools: \n     * n8n\n     * Make.com\n  2. Zapier's direct competitors: \n     * Pabbly Connect\n     * IFTTT\n     * Integrately\n  3. Enterprise automation platforms: \n     * Workato\n     * Tray.io\n     * MS Power Automate\n     * Mulesoft Composer\n\n\n\nHere’s a summary table of 9 best Zapier alternatives with their total scores in the 8 categories:\n\nCategory | Zapier | n8n | Make | Pabbly  \nConnect | IFTTT | Integrately | Workato | Tray.io | Power  \nAutomate | Mulesoft  \nComposer  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Overall  \nScore** | **74.4%** | **85.8%** | **81.4%** | **65.3%** | **65.3%** | **61.4%** | **81.2%** | **80.1%** | **84.6%** | **65.1%**  \nEase of Use &  \nAccessibility | 4.8 | 3.6 | 4.6 | 3.4 | 3.4 | 3.6 | 4.4 | 4.4 | 3.8 | 3.6  \nUser Support &  \nResources | 4.3 | 4.0 | 4.0 | 3.5 | 3.5 | 3.0 | 4.0 | 3.8 | 4.8 | 4.3  \nIntegration &  \nCompatibility | 3.6 | 4.6 | 4.4 | 3.9 | 3.5 | 3.8 | 4.6 | 4.4 | 4.8 | 3.1  \nWorkflow &  \nProcess Design | 3.3 | 4.2 | 4.1 | 2.7 | 2.5 | 2.5 | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4.5 | 3.4  \nReliability &  \nPerformance | 3.4 | 4.5 | 4.1 | 3.0 | 2.8 | 3.0 | 4.6 | 4.6 | 4.2 | 3.6  \nMonitoring &  \nManagement | 3.4 | 4.0 | 3.8 | 2.8 | 2.8 | 2.0 | 4.8 | 4.6 | 4.2 | 3.2  \nScalability &  \nExtensibility | 4.0 | 4.8 | 4.3 | 2.5 | 3.0 | 2.8 | 4.3 | 4.3 | 4.3 | 3.3  \nPricing &  \nSubscription | 3.0 | 4.7 | 3.3 | 4.3 | 4.7 | 4.0 | 1.3 | 1.5 | 3.3 | 1.7  \n  \nOur evaluation of 9 Zapier alternatives included scoring 50 features in 8 categories.\n\nWe semi-quantitatively assessed each platform, not only noting the presence of a feature but also rating the quality of its implementation:\n\n  * 6 out of 9 Zapier alternatives were tested manually (except Workato, Tray.io, and Mulesoft composer);\n  * For each tool, we looked at the documentation, watched tutorials, searched for user feedback, and read online forums;\n  * We scored each feature between 5 as the top mark and 1 indicating the complete absence of a feature. Scores for each category were averaged to derive an overall rating where no platform reached a perfect score.\n\n\n\n💡\n\nIn our previous article, on [8 open-source low-code platforms](https://blog.n8n.io/open-source-low-code-platforms/#final-thought), we briefly explained the methodology for selecting a software platform. In this listicle, we develop this idea further and provide a practical example of how to create a feature list and an evaluation process.\n\nHere’s a detailed table with all the features and categories we looked into:\n\nCategory | Feature | Feature Description  \n---|---|---  \n**Ease of Use & Accessibility**  \n_Usability and accessibility are critical  \nfor user adoption and productivity.  \nThis category addresses the overall  \nuser experience._ |  User-friendly UI  |  How user-friendly is the interface?   \nVisual Workflow Builder  |  Does the tool offer a visual editor for building automations?   \nWeb Interface Quality  |  How responsive and well-designed is the web interface?   \nUser Role Management  |  Can you assign roles and permissions to different users?   \nCollaboration Features  |  Are there features that support team collaboration on workflows?   \n**User Support & Resources**  \n_This category encompasses features  \nrelated to how users are supported  \nand educated about the tool_ |  Templates/Pre-made Scenarios  |  Are there ready-to-use templates or scenarios available?   \nCommunity Support  |  How active and helpful is the user community?   \nCustomer Service  |  What type of customer support is offered (live chat, email, phone)?   \nLearning Resources  |  Does the company provide comprehensive documentation, tutorials, or webinars?   \n**Integration & Compatibility**  \n_These criteria are essential  \nfor understanding the range and  \ndepth of integrations each tool  \noffers and how well they can fit  \ninto existing tech ecosystems._ |  Number of Integrations  |  How many integrations are available and what’s their overall quality?   \nBreadth of Connectivity  |  Aside from the number of integrations, how wide is the range of categories (CRM, marketing, finance, etc.) it covers?   \nAPI Access  |  Does the service provide API access for custom integrations?   \nWebhooks Support  |  Are webhooks supported for more advanced, customized workflows?   \nIntegration with Databases  |  Does it offer direct integration with various databases?   \nThird-party Software Compatibility  |  Beyond integrations, how well does the tool work with other software?   \nTwo-way Synchronization  |  Does it offer two-way sync between apps, or only one-way data push?   \nSystem Integration  |  How well does the tool integrate with existing IT systems and infrastructure?   \n**Workflow & Process Design**  \n_These criteria focus on  \nthe capabilities of each tool in  \ndesigning, creating, and managing  \ncomplex workflows._ |  Automation Complexity  |  What is the level of complexity each tool can handle in an automation workflow?   \nCustomization Options  |  How customizable are the workflows or integrations?   \nData Transformation  |  How robust are the data mapping and transformation capabilities?   \nMulti-step Workflows  |  Can users create multi-step workflows with conditional logic?   \nTrigger and Action Diversity  |  How varied are the triggers and actions available for each service?   \nUndo/Redo Functionality  |  Is there undo/redo functionality for editing workflows?   \nReal-time Processing  |  Does the tool support real-time data processing and instant triggers?   \nBatch Processing  |  Can the tool handle batch processing for tasks that don't need to be done in real-time?   \nLocal Development Environment  |  Is there an option for local development environment for testing and development purposes?   \nData Storage Options  |  What kind of data storage options are available (temporary data holding, data retention policies)?   \nMobile App Availability  |  Is there a mobile app, and what features does it offer?

The most expensive Team plan costs 64.68€/Mo. However, prices skyrocket over 5500€/Mo if the service is used intensively.\n\n#### Is Zapier free or paid?\n\nZapier has a very limited free plan for newcomers. Most advanced features are unlocked at paid tiers (premium integrations, multi-step Zaps, conditions and branching, autoreplay and so on).\n\n#### How long is Zapier free?\n\nZapier’s Free tier is free forever with a modest quota of 100 tasks per month. Due to feature-gating, users can create only the most simple 2-step Zaps on the free tier.\n\n#### Can you trust Zapier?\n\nZapier is a cloud platform, which means that you need to store all credentials in the cloud and transfer all data via Zapier’s servers. There are [several compliance certificates](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496181993613-Security-and-Compliance?ref=blog.n8n.io) for Zapier, but the on-prem features are not available.\n\n#### Is Zapier easy to learn?\n\nYes, Zapier is easy to learn and there are plenty of learning materials available.\n\n## Zapier or a Zapier alternative?\n\nEven though our Zapier alternatives comparison is as objective as possible, there are still some caveats.\n\nFirstly, we haven’t found an industry-led testing framework, so you may set different criteria.\n\nSecond, we considered each feature and category to be equally important. In real-world scenarios, evaluators should weigh each category or even each feature. For example, we might evaluate only nominal pricing. Some companies are more price-sensitive than others.\n\nAlso, certain features may be a must-have or a deal breaker, especially in an enterprise context with strict compliance rules. In our review, we only evaluated whether or not a feature was present and made a rough assessment of implementation.\n\nThese radar charts summarise our Zapier alternatives comparisons:\n\n### Zapier vs workflow automation tools\n\nOur findings show that Zapier scores very well in new client onboarding by offering a great UI, comprehensive documentation, a learning platform, and expert support. It also provides tools for managing multiple users.\n\nHowever, in all other categories, both n8n and Make.com receive higher ratings and offer enhanced functionality.\n\n### Zapier vs direct competitors\n\nWe looked at three popular tools that position themselves similarly to Zapier: Pabbly Connect, IFTTT and Integrately. All three tools have a much better price offering, but it comes at a cost.\n\nMost categories perform worse compared to Zapier and in many cases, these platforms look less polished overall. The only comparable category is “Integration & Compatibility”, mainly due to better generic HTTP Request connection.\n\nIn general, Zapier's direct competitors are better suited for individual non-tech marketing experts. As the team grows larger or the automations become more complex, we find that these tools are quickly overwhelmed.\n\n### Zapier vs enterprise automation platforms\n\nWe decided to compare Zapier with enterprise tools, as Zapier gets similarly expensive in the highest price ranges. And we got somewhat mixed results:\n\n  * MS Power Automate came out on top. This is a solid platform with clear pricing. The biggest downside is that the pricing might be deceptive, as Power Automate works best only in the Microsoft ecosystem, which itself is expensive.\n  * Workato and Tray.io are also strong players. The only downside is the completely obscure pricing. We had to do a lot of digging and reading to uncover some details, as the official pricing pages were not helpful.\n  * Finally, Mulesoft Composer got the lowest ratings. It seems to be a less powerful platform than the others and it’s also not immediately clear which features of the Mulesoft Anypoint platform are also available in Composer.\n\n\n\nWith this comprehensive guide, you now can better decide which Zapier alternative suits your needs best.\n\n## What’s next\n\nWith n8n, you can start building any workflow you need for free, with no limit on operations.\n\nHere are just some examples of workflows being used to solve complex problems and save time:\n\n### Run your workflows with no limit on operations\n\n__![Google
