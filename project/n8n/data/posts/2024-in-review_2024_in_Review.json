The marriage of n8n's 'traditional' workflow automation tools with LLMs, Vector Stores, Agents, and Tools has proven to be extremely successful, unlocking powerful automations with relative ease.\n\nWe rolled out a wide range of new AI features that make workflows smarter, faster, and more efficient:\n\n  * **Chat Trigger** : Improved canvas chat and far better logging, allowing for more insight into the information flow between components.\n  * **New AI Models** : Expanded support to include Claude, Gemini, Groq, and Vertex models, giving users greater flexibility.\n  * **External Vector Stores** : Integration with more external vector stores opened new possibilities for working with large datasets.\n  * **AI Nodes** : New tools like the AI Transform Node and AI App Tools made it easier to process, generate, and analyze data.\n  * **AI Agents** : AI Agents enabled workflows to operate autonomously, taking automation to the next level.\n\n\n\nWe also launched the [Self-Hosted AI Starter Kit](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/starter-kits/ai-starter-kit/?ref=blog.n8n.io), allowing teams to run their AI workflows and LLMs on their own infrastructure and to keep their data private.\n\nCurious to learn more?
