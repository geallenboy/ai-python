Syncing data is an ongoing process that keeps databases in 24/7 communication and makes changes between the source and target to ensure they are identical.</p>\n<p>So, what is a data synchronization example? Here you go:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Customer data has to be consistent throughout different systems from an internal CRM to a billing and order management system;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Employee personal data must be properly defined in all IT systems, avoiding manual input errors and data inconsistency;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Database administrators, when managing globally distributed applications in different regions, are in need of having data synchronized.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-types-of-data-synchronization\">What are the types of data synchronization?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"one-way-synchronization\">One-way synchronization</h3>\n<p>In one-way sync (unidirectional sync), information is updated only in one direction. Practically, data are added/updated from a primary location (source) to a secondary location (target) in one direction, but no files data are ever copied back to the primary location.</p>\n<p>A one-way sync is useful when information like Contacts or Orders are only ever updated in your source system, or when you back up files. In this case, we say that the source is mirrored to target, as the secondary location is in sync with the primary location.</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-way-synchronization\">Two-way synchronization</h3>\n<p>In a two-way sync (or bidirectional sync), information is updated in both directions. This means that if the information is updated in the first location, then it will be automatically updated in the second location as well â€“ and vice-versa. This is assuming that both systems are actively used, so users can enter data in both systems.</p>\n<p>A two-way sync is useful when two different systems are actively used to store information, for example, if one system offers more features that are relevant for the sales team, but the relevant company-wide information is stored in another system. In this case, we say that the two systems are equivalent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-synchronize-my-data-automatically\">How do I synchronize my data automatically?</h2>\n<p>Next, we'll put the theory into practice and implement a no-code, one-way and two- way data sync workflows in n8n. To get you started, youâ€™ll need:</p>\n<h3 id=\"workflow-prerequisites\">Workflow prerequisites</h3>\n<p>The workflows presented in this post are available on our <a href=\"https://n8n.io/workflows?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">workflows page</a>. If you want to follow along with the tutorial, you need to have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>n8n set up. You can either install the desktop app (for <a href=\"https://downloads.n8n.io/file/n8n-downloads/n8n-mac.zip?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mac</a> or <a href=\"https://downloads.n8n.io/file/n8n-downloads/n8n-win.zip?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Windows</a>), sign up for a <a href=\"https://n8n.io/cloud/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">n8n cloud instance</a>, or set up n8n <a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">locally</a></li>\n<li>Pipedrive and HubSpot accounts and credentials</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"one-way-sync-workflow-sync-contacts-from-pipedrive-in-hubspot\">One-way sync workflow: Sync contacts from Pipedrive in HubSpot</h3>\n<p>Let's consider a common business use case: storing information about customers (such as contact name and email) in two CRMs, for instance, Pipedrive and HubSpot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://n8n.io/workflows/1334?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This workflow</a> syncs contact information from Pipedrive to HubSpot, so that when the information is updated in Pipedrive, then it's updated in HubSpot as well. The workflow for this use case looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.05.57.png\" alt=\"Explanation of one-way sync workflow\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align=\"center\"><i>Explanation of one-way sync workflow</i></figcaption></figure>\n<ol>\n<li>The <em>Cron node</em> schedules the workflow to run every minute.\\</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>ðŸ’¡ Schedule or trigger the workflow</strong>: Note that for this use case, you can have <a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedriveTrigger/?ref=blog.n8n.io#example-usage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a workflow</a> with the <em>Pipedrive Trigger node</em>, which triggers the workflow any time information is updated in Pipedrive. But if you need to sync data between apps or services that don't have an n8n Trigger node, you need to use the <em>Cron node</em> as a trigger.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>The <em>Pipedrive</em> and <em>Hubspot1  nodes</em> pull in both lists of persons from Pipedrive and contacts from HubSpot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <em>Merge node</em> with the option <em>Remove Key Matches</em> identifies the items that uniquely exist in Pipedrive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <em>Hubspot2 node</em> takes those unique items and adds them to HubSpot.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now let's see how to set up each node.</p>\n<h4 id=\"1-get-data-from-the-source-crm\">1. Get data from the source CRM</h4>\n<p>In the <em>Pipedrive node</em>, add your <a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/pipedrive/?ref=blog.n8n.io#prerequisites\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">credentials</a> in the Pipedrive API section. Then, configure the following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Resource</em>: Person</li>\n<li><em>Operation</em>: Get All</li>\n<li><em>Return All</em>: Toggle to True</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.20.png\" alt=\"Configuration of Pipedrive node to get data\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align=\"center\"><i>Configuration of Pipedrive node to get data</i></figcaption></figure>\n<h4 id=\"2-get-data-from-the-target-crm\">2.

Then, configure the following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Resource</em>: Contact</li>\n<li><em>Operation</em>: Get All</li>\n<li><em>Return All</em>: Toggle to True</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.26.png\" alt=\"Configuration of HubSpot node to get data\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align=\"center\"><i>Configuration of HubSpot node to get data</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In HubSpot, we have three contacts, which are also in Pipedrive. We want to add the fourth person from Pipedrive into HubSpot.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3-merge-data-from-source-and-target-crms\">3. Merge data from source and target CRMs</h4>\n<p>Now that the data is all set, it's ready to be merged. For our use case, we want to identify contacts that exist only in Pipedrive and add them to HubSpot.</p>\n<p>In a one-way sync workflow, it's important to know clearly from the beginning which system serves as the source, as that would be <strong>Input 1</strong> (in our case, Pipedrive). The target system would then be <strong>Input 2</strong> (in our case, HubSpot).</p>\n<p>The <em>Merge node</em> receives data from Input 1, goes back to Input 2 and executes the node(s) in order, then outputs the merged data from Input 1 and Input 2.</p>\n<p>To match data between two systems, the <em>Merge node</em> needs a piece of information that is present in both systems, to serve as a reference. This reference is a key column â€“ a common column between the two tables that contains key values, which uniquely identify rows in the table.</p>\n<p>For this reason, the key values must be different in each row. The key column can be, for example, the customer's email address, an SKU, or the order number.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.37.png\" alt=\"Illustration of the one-way sync process\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align=\"center\"><i>Illustration of the one-way sync process</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In our case, the key column between Pipedrive and HubSpot is <em>email</em>, so we'll merge data based on this column.</p>\n<p>Back to the workflow, in the <em>Merge node</em>, configure the following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Mode</em>: Remove Key Matches<br>\nThis operation  keeps data of Input 1 if it doesn't find a match with an <a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">item</a> of data from Input 2.</li>\n<li><em>Property Input 1</em>: email[0].value</li>\n<li><em>Property Input 2</em>: identity-profiles[0].identities[0].value<br>\nThe source key column is passed in <em>Property Input 1</em> and the target key column is passed in <em>Property Input 2</em>.\\</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ðŸ’¡ For <em>Property Input 1</em> and <em>Property Input 2</em>, you need to enter the property key in <strong>dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).</strong></p>\n<h4 id=\"what-is-dot-notation\">What is dot-notation?</h4>\n<p>In n8n, all the data that is passed between nodes is an array of objects. When you execute a node, the returned data is displayed in Table view and JSON view.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.46.png\" alt=\"Table and JSON view\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align=\"center\"><i>Table and JSON view</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Dot notation</strong> is a way to access the properties of an object. The dot-notation syntax is <code>object.property</code>, so the reference is made from outermost to innermost.</p>\n<p>In the example above, the object (column name) <em>email</em> contains three properties: <em>label</em>, <em>value</em>, and <em>primary</em>. To reference the <em>email</em> value (email address), we write the dot notation <code>email[0].value</code>. The <code>[0]</code> references the first item of the email array.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.51.png\" alt=\"Configuration of Merge node\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align=\"center\"><i>Configuration of Merge node</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The merge operation <em>Remove Key Matches</em> returns the data of three contacts.</p>\n<h4 id=\"4-update-data-in-the-target-crm\">4. Update data in the target CRM</h4>\n<p>Once the data is merged, you need to update the information in the target system (HubSpot).</p>\n<p>To update contact information in HubSpot, configure the following parameters in the <em>HubSpot node</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Resource</em>: Contact</li>\n<li><em>Operation</em>: Create/Update</li>\n<li><em>Email &gt; Add Expression &gt; Current Node &gt; Output Data &gt; JSON &gt; email &gt; [Item: 0] &gt; value</em>: <code>{{$json[\"email\"][0][\"value\"]}}</code></li>\n<li><em>Additional Fields &gt; Add Field &gt; First Name &gt; Add Expression &gt; Current Node &gt; Output Data &gt; JSON &gt; first_name</em>: <code>{{$json[\"first_name\"]}}</code></li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.57.png\" alt=\"Configuration of HubSpot node to update data\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align=\"center\"><i>Configuration of HubSpot node to update data</i></figcaption></figure>\n<h3 id=\"two-way-sync-workflow-sync-contacts-between-hubspot-and-pipedrive\">Two-way sync workflow: Sync contacts between HubSpot and Pipedrive</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://n8n.io/workflows/1333?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this workflow</a>, the information about Pipedrive persons and HubSpot contacts (their name and email) is updated in both Pipedrive and HubSpot when you make changes in either source.</p>\n<p>In a two-way sync workflow in n8n, you essentially have two parallel workflows, each including a <em>Merge node</em> that takes input from the opposite and inline workflow. For our use case, the workflow looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.07.02.png\" alt=\"Two-way sync workflow\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align=\"center\"><i>Two-way sync workflow</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The first part of the workflow starts with the <em>Pipedrive node</em>, which fetches the data when information about a person is updated in the CRM.

In the <em>Merge1 node</em>, set the following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Mode</em>: Remove Key Matches</li>\n<li><em>Property Input 1</em>: identity-profiles[0].identities[0].value</li>\n<li><em>Property Input 2</em>: email[0].value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second <em>Merge2 node</em> is connected to HubSpot, so it takes Input 1 from Pipedrive and Input 2 from HubSpot.

  "readme": "Whether you work in marketing, sales, or data engineering, you most likely use several apps or services for collecting and storing data from different sources. To boost productivity and reduce errors, you can automate various tasks in each system â€“ from [lead capturing in CRMs](https://blog.n8n.io/how-to-get-started-with-crm-automation-and-no-code-workflow-ideas/) to [e-commerce workflows](https://blog.n8n.io/no-code-ecommerce-workflow-automations/) and [data processing pipelines](https://blog.n8n.io/automate-your-data-processing-pipeline-in-9-steps-with-n8n/).\n\nHowever, the challenge is still there: how to synchronize data across different sources so that the information is consistent within all systems?\n\n![Aggregation of data from different sources](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.05.48.png)_Aggregation of data from different sources_\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn step-by-step how to auto sync data using the [_**Merge node**_](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/?ref=blog.n8n.io#node-reference) built by [n8n workflow automaton tool](https://n8n.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io). With n8n, data from two systems can be **synced in one direction (one-way sync) or in two directions (two-way sync)**. The use case for this post is synchronizing data between two CRMs ([Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io) and [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io)), but the underlying principle can be applied to any other apps.\n\nBut first things firstâ€¦\n\n#### Table of contents\n\nWhat is data synchronization?  \nWhat are the types of data synchronization?  \nOne-way synchronization  \nTwo-way synchronization  \nHow do I synchronize my data automatically?  \nWorkflow prerequisites  \nOne-way sync workflow: Sync contacts from Pipedrive in HubSpot  \n       1\\.

Update data in both CRMs  \nWrap Up  \nWhat's next?\n\n## What is data synchronization?\n\nData synchronization is a process that ensures your data is up-to-date, relevant, and complete, thus helping you make informed decisions for your business. Syncing data is an ongoing process that keeps databases in 24/7 communication and makes changes between the source and target to ensure they are identical.\n\nSo, what is a data synchronization example? Here you go:\n\n  * Customer data has to be consistent throughout different systems from an internal CRM to a billing and order management system;\n\n  * Employee personal data must be properly defined in all IT systems, avoiding manual input errors and data inconsistency;\n\n  * Database administrators, when managing globally distributed applications in different regions, are in need of having data synchronized.\n\n\n\n\n## What are the types of data synchronization?\n\n### One-way synchronization\n\nIn one-way sync (unidirectional sync), information is updated only in one direction. Practically, data are added/updated from a primary location (source) to a secondary location (target) in one direction, but no files data are ever copied back to the primary location.\n\nA one-way sync is useful when information like Contacts or Orders are only ever updated in your source system, or when you back up files. In this case, we say that the source is mirrored to target, as the secondary location is in sync with the primary location.\n\n### Two-way synchronization\n\nIn a two-way sync (or bidirectional sync), information is updated in both directions. This means that if the information is updated in the first location, then it will be automatically updated in the second location as well â€“ and vice-versa. This is assuming that both systems are actively used, so users can enter data in both systems.\n\nA two-way sync is useful when two different systems are actively used to store information, for example, if one system offers more features that are relevant for the sales team, but the relevant company-wide information is stored in another system. In this case, we say that the two systems are equivalent.\n\n## How do I synchronize my data automatically?\n\nNext, we'll put the theory into practice and implement a no-code, one-way and two- way data sync workflows in n8n. To get you started, youâ€™ll need:\n\n### Workflow prerequisites\n\nThe workflows presented in this post are available on our [workflows page](https://n8n.io/workflows?ref=blog.n8n.io). If you want to follow along with the tutorial, you need to have:\n\n  * n8n set up. You can either install the desktop app (for [Mac](https://downloads.n8n.io/file/n8n-downloads/n8n-mac.zip?ref=blog.n8n.io) or [Windows](https://downloads.n8n.io/file/n8n-downloads/n8n-win.zip?ref=blog.n8n.io)), sign up for a [n8n cloud instance](https://n8n.io/cloud/?ref=blog.n8n.io), or set up n8n [locally](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n  * Pipedrive and HubSpot accounts and credentials\n\n\n\n### One-way sync workflow: Sync contacts from Pipedrive in HubSpot\n\nLet's consider a common business use case: storing information about customers (such as contact name and email) in two CRMs, for instance, Pipedrive and HubSpot.\n\n[This workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1334?ref=blog.n8n.io) syncs contact information from Pipedrive to HubSpot, so that when the information is updated in Pipedrive, then it's updated in HubSpot as well. The workflow for this use case looks like this:\n\n![Explanation of one-way sync workflow](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.05.57.png)_Explanation of one-way sync workflow_\n\n  1. The _Cron node_ schedules the workflow to run every minute.\\\n\n\n\n**ðŸ’¡ Schedule or trigger the workflow** : Note that for this use case, you can have [a workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedriveTrigger/?ref=blog.n8n.io#example-usage) with the _Pipedrive Trigger node_ , which triggers the workflow any time information is updated in Pipedrive. But if you need to sync data between apps or services that don't have an n8n Trigger node, you need to use the _Cron node_ as a trigger.\n\n  2. The _Pipedrive_ and _Hubspot1 nodes_ pull in both lists of persons from Pipedrive and contacts from HubSpot.\n\n  3. The _Merge node_ with the option _Remove Key Matches_ identifies the items that uniquely exist in Pipedrive.\n\n  4. The _Hubspot2 node_ takes those unique items and adds them to HubSpot.\n\n\n\n\nNow let's see how to set up each node.\n\n#### 1\\. Get data from the source CRM\n\nIn the _Pipedrive node_ , add your [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/pipedrive/?ref=blog.n8n.io#prerequisites) in the Pipedrive API section. Then, configure the following parameters:\n\n  * _Resource_ : Person\n  * _Operation_ : Get All\n  * _Return All_ : Toggle to True\n\n![Configuration of Pipedrive node to get data](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.20.png)_Configuration of Pipedrive node to get data_\n\n#### 2\\. Get data from the target CRM\n\nIn the _HubSpot node_ , add your [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/hubspot?ref=blog.n8n.io) in the HubSpot API section. Then, configure the following parameters:\n\n  * _Resource_ : Contact\n  * _Operation_ : Get All\n  * _Return All_ : Toggle to True\n\n![Configuration of HubSpot node to get data](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.26.png)_Configuration of HubSpot node to get data_\n\nIn HubSpot, we have three contacts, which are also in Pipedrive. We want to add the fourth person from Pipedrive into HubSpot.\n\n#### 3\\. Merge data from source and target CRMs\n\nNow that the data is all set, it's ready to be merged. For our use case, we want to identify contacts that exist only in Pipedrive and add them to HubSpot.\n\nIn a one-way sync workflow, it's important to know clearly from the beginning which system serves as the source, as that would be **Input 1** (in our case, Pipedrive). The target system would then be **Input 2** (in our case, HubSpot).\n\nThe _Merge node_ receives data from Input 1, goes back to Input 2 and executes the node(s) in order, then outputs the merged data from Input 1 and Input 2.\n\nTo match data between two systems, the _Merge node_ needs a piece of information that is present in both systems, to serve as a reference. This reference is a key column â€“ a common column between the two tables that contains key values, which uniquely identify rows in the table.\n\nFor this reason, the key values must be different in each row. The key column can be, for example, the customer's email address, an SKU, or the order number.\n\n![Illustration of the one-way sync process](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.37.png)_Illustration of the one-way sync process_\n\nIn our case, the key column between Pipedrive and HubSpot is _email_ , so we'll merge data based on this column.\n\nBack to the workflow, in the _Merge node_ , configure the following parameters:\n\n  * _Mode_ : Remove Key Matches  \nThis operation keeps data of Input 1 if it doesn't find a match with an [item](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/?ref=blog.n8n.io) of data from Input 2.\n  * _Property Input 1_ : email[0].value\n  * _Property Input 2_ : identity-profiles[0].identities[0].value  \nThe source key column is passed in _Property Input 1_ and the target key column is passed in _Property Input 2_.\\\n\n\n\nðŸ’¡ For _Property Input 1_ and _Property Input 2_ , you need to enter the property key in **dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).**\n\n#### What is dot-notation?\n\nIn n8n, all the data that is passed between nodes is an array of objects. When you execute a node, the returned data is displayed in Table view and JSON view.\n\n![Table and JSON view](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.46.png)_Table and JSON view_\n\n**Dot notation** is a way to access the properties of an object. The dot-notation syntax is `object.property`, so the reference is made from outermost to innermost.\n\nIn the example above, the object (column name) _email_ contains three properties: _label_ , _value_ , and _primary_. To reference the _email_ value (email address), we write the dot notation `email[0].value`. The `[0]` references the first item of the email array.\n\n![Configuration of Merge node](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.51.png)_Configuration of Merge node_\n\nThe merge operation _Remove Key Matches_ returns the data of three contacts.\n\n#### 4\\. Update data in the target CRM\n\nOnce the data is merged, you need to update the information in the target system (HubSpot).\n\nTo update contact information in HubSpot, configure the following parameters in the _HubSpot node_ :\n\n  * _Resource_ : Contact\n  * _Operation_ : Create/Update\n  * _Email > Add Expression > Current Node > Output Data > JSON > email > [Item: 0] > value_: `{{$json[\"email\"][0][\"value\"]}}`\n  * _Additional Fields > Add Field > First Name > Add Expression > Current Node > Output Data > JSON > first_name_: `{{$json[\"first_name\"]}}`\n\n![Configuration of HubSpot node to update data](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.06.57.png)_Configuration of HubSpot node to update data_\n\n### Two-way sync workflow: Sync contacts between HubSpot and Pipedrive\n\nIn [this workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1333?ref=blog.n8n.io), the information about Pipedrive persons and HubSpot contacts (their name and email) is updated in both Pipedrive and HubSpot when you make changes in either source.\n\nIn a two-way sync workflow in n8n, you essentially have two parallel workflows, each including a _Merge node_ that takes input from the opposite and inline workflow. For our use case, the workflow looks like this:\n\n![Two-way sync workflow](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.07.02.png)_Two-way sync workflow_\n\nThe first part of the workflow starts with the _Pipedrive node_ , which fetches the data when information about a person is updated in the CRM. The second part of the workflow starts with the _HubSpot node_ , which fetches the data when information about a contact is updated in HubSpot.\n\n  1. The _Cron node_ schedules the workflow to run every minute.\n  2. The _Pipedrive_ and _Hubspot nodes_ pull in both lists of persons from Pipedrive and contacts from HubSpot.\n  3. The _Merge1_ and _Merge2 nodes_ with the option _Remove Key Matches_ identify the items that uniquely exist in HubSpot and Pipedrive, respectively.\n  4. The _Update Pipedrive_ and _Update HubSpot nodes_ take those unique items and add them in Pipedrive and HubSpot, respectively.\n\n\n\nNow let's see how to set up each node.\n\n#### 1\\. Get data from both CRMs\n\nThe setup of the _Pipedrive_ and _HubSpot nodes_ is the same as in the one-way sync workflow above.\n\nIn the _Pipedrive node_ , configure the following parameters:\n\n  * _Resource_ : Person\n  * _Operation_ : Get All\n  * _Return All_ : Toggle to True\n\n\n\nIn the _HubSpot node_ , configure the following parameters:\n\n  * _Resource_ : Contact\n  * _Operation_ : Get All\n  * _Return All_ : Toggle to True\n\n\n\n#### 2\\. Merge data from the two CRMs\n\nTo merge data from Pipedrive and HubSpot, you need to use two _Merge nodes_ , one for each system.\n\nThe first _Merge1 node_ is connected to Pipedrive, so it takes Input 1 from HubSpot and Input 2 from Pipedrive. In the _Merge1 node_ , set the following parameters:\n\n  * _Mode_ : Remove Key Matches\n  * _Property Input 1_ : identity-profiles[0].identities[0].value\n  * _Property Input 2_ : email[0].value\n\n\n\nThe second _Merge2 node_ is connected to HubSpot, so it takes Input 1 from Pipedrive and Input 2 from HubSpot. In the _Merge2 node_ , set the following parameters:\n\n  * _Mode_ : Remove Key Matches\n  * _Property Input 1_ : email[0].value\n  * _Property Input 2_ : identity-profiles[0].identities[0].value\n\n![Output of Merge node](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.07.09.png)_Output of Merge node_\n\n#### 3\\. Update data in both CRMs\n\nOnce the data is merged, you need to update the information in both systems.\n\nTo update person information in Pipedrive, configure the following parameters in the _Pipedrive node_ :\n\n  * _Resource_ : Person\n  * _Operation_ : Create\n  * _Name > Add Expression_: `{{$json[\"properties\"][\"firstname\"][\"value\"]}}`\n  * _Additional Fields > Email > Add item > Add Expression_: `{{$json[\"identity-profiles\"][0][\"identities\"][0][\"value\"]}}`\n\n\n\nTo update contact information in HubSpot, configure the following parameters in the _HubSpot node_ :\n\n  * _Resource_ : Contact\n  * _Operation_ : Create/Update\n  * _Email > Add Expression_: `{{$json[\"email\"][0][\"value\"]}}`\n  * _Additional Fields > Add Field > First Name > Add Expression_: `{{$json[\"properties\"][\"firstname\"][\"value\"]}}`\n\n![Output of updated HubSpot node](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-01-at-16.07.15.png)_Output of updated HubSpot node_\n\nNow both Pipedrive and HubSpot contain the latest, up-to-date information about contacts.\n\n## Wrap Up\n\nIn this tutorial, you've learned how to synchronize data between two CRMs using n8n workflow automation tool. However, you can further adapt these data sync workflows for different apps and services.\n\nFor example, you can sync data between different databases like [Postgres](https://n8n.io/integrations/postgres/?ref=blog.n8n.io) or [MongoDB](https://n8n.io/integrations/mongodb/?ref=blog.n8n.io), sales data between [Salesforce](https://n8n.io/integrations/salesforce/?ref=blog.n8n.io) and [Shopify](https://n8n.io/integrations/shopify/?ref=blog.n8n.io), or marketing data between [Google BigQuery](https://n8n.io/integrations/google-bigquery/?ref=blog.n8n.io) and [MailChimp](https://n8n.io/integrations/mailchimp/?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n\nTo get you started faster, [n8nâ€™s free trials](https://n8n.io/pricing/?ref=blog.n8n.io) are available!\n\n## What's next?\n\nIf youâ€™d like to take a look at the ready-to-go data sync use cases, read more on:\n\n  * [how to import data from Google Sheets into Salesforce](https://blog.n8n.io/salesforce-data-import/) as an alternative for the Salesforce Import Wizard,\n  * [how to import CSV into MySQL](https://blog.n8n.io/import-csv-into-mysql/), a straightforward way to solve integration issues between CSV files and popular databases such as MySQL,\n  * [how to scrape data automatically](https://blog.n8n.io/how-to-scrape-data-from-a-website/) with n8n, if your data scraping target is not as easy as you think.\n\n\n\nDiscover more workflow ideas on the [workflows page](https://n8n.io/workflows?ref=blog.n8n.io) and in the [community forum](https://community.n8n.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io)!\n\n## Subscribe to n8n newsletter\n\nGet the best, coolest, and latest in automation and low-code delivered to your inbox each week. \n\nSomething went wrong.
