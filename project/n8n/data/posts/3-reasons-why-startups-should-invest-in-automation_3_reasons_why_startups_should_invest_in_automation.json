And if you’re only factoring in the costs, then you’re approaching automation from the wrong angle.</p><p>Automation provides you with <a href=\"https://www.luhhu.com/blog/how-to-make-automation-and-process-improvement-a-habit-in-your-business?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several unique opportunities</a> and benefits that can help your business reach new heights. And in 2021, many of these benefits are ones that you can’t do without, especially if you’re a startup.</p><p>Here are just a few of the unique benefits automation can provide you with over time.</p><h3 id=\"1-you-earn-back-at-least-as-much-as-you-put-into-automation\">1. You earn back at least as much as you put into automation</h3><p>As we touched on before, automation provides you with some serious ROI. In fact, the ROI of automation is probably the primary reason it’s become as prolific as it has over the last decade.</p><p>There are three key ways that automation provides you with a substantial ROI. Nearly every automation workflow will provide a return on all three of these fronts in some way.</p><ol><li><strong>Automation gives you more time.</strong> It completes tasks for you so that you can complete other tasks with that time instead, making you more productive while doing the same amount of work. </li><li><strong>Automation increases your revenue. </strong>Whether you use your new free time to raise revenue yourself or your workflows are passively generating more revenue for you, automation provides financial returns. </li><li><strong>Automation frees up your energy.</strong> It’s no secret that most of us are as stressed out and overwhelmed as we can handle.

Hello, 6.30pm finish time — how we’ve missed you!</li></ol><h3 id=\"2-automation-can-make-a-small-team-a-big-hitter\"><strong>2. Automation can make a small team a big hitter</strong></h3><p>Another crucial benefit of automation is how powerful it can make your team. And when you’re a startup, this is a benefit you’d be mad to miss out on.</p><p>Employed correctly, automation gives you more manpower without needing to hire more staff. If you’re new to your industry, this can be the difference between success and failure. It makes you more competitive, gives you more space to innovate, and reduces the chances of your small team burning out.</p><h3 id=\"3-your-ability-to-handle-growth-will-increase-dramatically\"><strong>3. Your ability to handle growth will increase dramatically</strong></h3><p>Finally, investing in automation increases your ability to handle the scale of your business, even when it changes. A sudden surge in growth can cripple some businesses. They don’t have the staff, resources, or experience to handle the increase in scale, and end up crumbling under the pressure.</p><p>Automated workflows, however, don’t crumble when more pressure is put on them. They just keep automating. That means your business could theoretically triple in size — without missing a beat.</p><h2 id=\"increase-revenue-loyalty-and-growth-with-simple-automation-strategies\">Increase revenue, loyalty, and growth with simple automation strategies</h2><p>You don’t need to be a multi-million dollar corporation to make automation work for you.</p><p>In fact, small and scrappy startups are the perfect fit for automated workflows and streamlined operations. By implementing simple strategies and affordable platforms (like yours truly, n8n) you can start to grow your business at a rapid yet sustainable rate.</p><p>Is that something you can afford to pass up?</p><hr><p><em>So, are you ready to start automating your startup?

If you’re new to your industry, this can be the difference between success and failure. It makes you more competitive, gives you more space to innovate, and reduces the chances of your small team burning out.\n\n### **3\\. Your ability to handle growth will increase dramatically**\n\nFinally, investing in automation increases your ability to handle the scale of your business, even when it changes. A sudden surge in growth can cripple some businesses. They don’t have the staff, resources, or experience to handle the increase in scale, and end up crumbling under the pressure.\n\nAutomated workflows, however, don’t crumble when more pressure is put on them. They just keep automating. That means your business could theoretically triple in size — without missing a beat.\n\n## Increase revenue, loyalty, and growth with simple automation strategies\n\nYou don’t need to be a multi-million dollar corporation to make automation work for you.\n\nIn fact, small and scrappy startups are the perfect fit for automated workflows and streamlined operations. By implementing simple strategies and affordable platforms (like yours truly, n8n) you can start to grow your business at a rapid yet sustainable rate.\n\nIs that something you can afford to pass up?\n\n* * *\n\n_So, are you ready to start automating your startup?
