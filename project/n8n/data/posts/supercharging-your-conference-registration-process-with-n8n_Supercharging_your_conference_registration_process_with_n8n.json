  "html": "<p>Every year, I help organize the <a href=\"https://www.simunglobal.org/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">South Indian Model United Nations</a>, the third-largest Model UN conference in South India. We host over 850+ students and a total of around 1000 attendees at our conference each year. The team cuts across a lot of data about our speakers, sessions, and attendees. We do this with a team of just 10 people.</p><h3 id=\"automate-repetitive-tasks\">Automate repetitive tasks</h3><p>Once you start organizing several of these conferences, you start to realize that a lot of human effort can be reduced by automating some seemingly mundane tasks — almost 45%, according to an <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation?ref=blog.n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> published by McKinsey &amp; Company.</p><p>One example that I can think of for this is the registration process for attendees. With COVID-19 forcing us to virtualize our conference, moving online has presented us with new challenges for the registration and onboarding of delegates — we now have to coordinate video conferences, permissions management, payments, chat rooms, to name a few.</p><p>So, that’s what we did. I set out on a quest to automate our initial registration process — saving us time and ensuring that attendees aren’t left waiting for days on a payment confirmation or sending us emails about confirming their registration. <em>And it’s magical.</em></p><p>If you’re organizing an event or would like to explore, you can follow along with this post using <a href=\"https://n8n.io/workflows/730?ref=blog.n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this workflow</a> (the workflow was built using n8n@0.111.0).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/03/final-workflow.png\" class=\"kg-image lightense-target\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1133\" srcset=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/final-workflow.png 600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/final-workflow.png 1000w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/03/final-workflow.png 1600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/03/final-workflow.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em class=\"markup--em markup--figure-em\">The workflow I used to process registrations with the data collected from&nbsp;Typeform</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2><h3 id=\"set-up-n8n\">Set up n8n</h3><p>You can get <a href=\"https://n8n.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">n8n</a> up and running by following the instructions on the <a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/quickstart/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quickstart</a> page. Once you’re done, you should see a fresh install of n8n without any workflows. You can also sign-up for a <a href=\"https://n8n.io/cloud?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free n8n cloud trial</a> to get access to our hosted service.</p><h3 id=\"set-up-a-form-in-typeform\">Set up a form in Typeform</h3><p>Since we’re going to be using this workflow to process conference registrations, we need a way to collect the information of all those who register. A form is an ideal tool for this, and I chose to use Typeform because it is straightforward to use (and works great with n8n!).</p><p>I set up a Typeform with just three questions, choosing to forego any complicated questions for brevity. It looks like the following.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"js-reframe\" style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.1798%;\"><iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gw3FSNA3L9g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0px; top: 0px;\"></iframe></div><figcaption>Video: The registration form being filled</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"set-up-a-mattermost-instance\">Set up a Mattermost instance</h3><p>Online chat rooms are great tools to facilitate in-conference communication. I chose to use <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mattermost</a> for this purpose as it is robust, open-source, straightforward to use, and supports mobile apps for both iOS and Android.</p><p>To set up an instance of Mattermost, you can follow the guides in the <a href=\"https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/administrator.html?ref=blog.n8n.io#installing-mattermost\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">official documentation</a>.</p><p>Once you’re done, create a channel for every session that you plan to organize at your conference.</p><h3 id=\"set-up-a-spreadsheet-in-google-sheets\">Set up a spreadsheet in Google Sheets</h3><p>I wanted to be able to easily view and manipulate the information collected from the Typeform. I decided to use Google Sheets for this task. This Google Sheets document will also contain an additional spreadsheet in it (shown as a tab on the bottom) that we will use to store information about the Mattermost channels and Google Calendar events for each session.</p><p>You can find a copy of my Google Sheets file <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TsRJqFVeLQv73hL9-Wjwk5m0yk3jfDVKnXs1ZoXTyy4/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, feel free to use it as a template when building this workflow. Make sure to have the same sheet and column names, as these are referenced in the nodes.</p><p>Here’s a screenshot of my spreadsheet for reference.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/sheet-3.png\" class=\"kg-image lightense-target\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1567\" height=\"629\" srcset=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sheet-3.png 600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/sheet-3.png 1000w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/sheet-3.png 1567w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Setting up a spreadsheet in Google&nbsp;Sheets</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"quickstart\">Quickstart</h2><p>Many people want to experience the result before committing to a project and spending time.

  "readme": "Every year, I help organize the [South Indian Model United Nations](https://www.simunglobal.org/?ref=blog.n8n.io), the third-largest Model UN conference in South India. We host over 850+ students and a total of around 1000 attendees at our conference each year. The team cuts across a lot of data about our speakers, sessions, and attendees. We do this with a team of just 10 people.\n\n### Automate repetitive tasks\n\nOnce you start organizing several of these conferences, you start to realize that a lot of human effort can be reduced by automating some seemingly mundane tasks — almost 45%, according to an [article](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation?ref=blog.n8n.io) published by McKinsey & Company.\n\nOne example that I can think of for this is the registration process for attendees. With COVID-19 forcing us to virtualize our conference, moving online has presented us with new challenges for the registration and onboarding of delegates — we now have to coordinate video conferences, permissions management, payments, chat rooms, to name a few.\n\nSo, that’s what we did. I set out on a quest to automate our initial registration process — saving us time and ensuring that attendees aren’t left waiting for days on a payment confirmation or sending us emails about confirming their registration. _And it’s magical._\n\nIf you’re organizing an event or would like to explore, you can follow along with this post using [this workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/730?ref=blog.n8n.io) (the workflow was built using n8n@0.111.0).\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/03/final-workflow.png)_The workflow I used to process registrations with the data collected from  Typeform_\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Set up n8n\n\nYou can get [n8n](https://n8n.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io) up and running by following the instructions on the [Quickstart](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/quickstart/?ref=blog.n8n.io) page. Once you’re done, you should see a fresh install of n8n without any workflows. You can also sign-up for a [free n8n cloud trial](https://n8n.io/cloud?ref=blog.n8n.io) to get access to our hosted service.\n\n### Set up a form in Typeform\n\nSince we’re going to be using this workflow to process conference registrations, we need a way to collect the information of all those who register. A form is an ideal tool for this, and I chose to use Typeform because it is straightforward to use (and works great with n8n!).\n\nI set up a Typeform with just three questions, choosing to forego any complicated questions for brevity. It looks like the following.\n\nVideo: The registration form being filled\n\n### Set up a Mattermost instance\n\nOnline chat rooms are great tools to facilitate in-conference communication. I chose to use [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io) for this purpose as it is robust, open-source, straightforward to use, and supports mobile apps for both iOS and Android.\n\nTo set up an instance of Mattermost, you can follow the guides in the [official documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/administrator.html?ref=blog.n8n.io#installing-mattermost).\n\nOnce you’re done, create a channel for every session that you plan to organize at your conference.\n\n### Set up a spreadsheet in Google Sheets\n\nI wanted to be able to easily view and manipulate the information collected from the Typeform. I decided to use Google Sheets for this task. This Google Sheets document will also contain an additional spreadsheet in it (shown as a tab on the bottom) that we will use to store information about the Mattermost channels and Google Calendar events for each session.\n\nYou can find a copy of my Google Sheets file [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TsRJqFVeLQv73hL9-Wjwk5m0yk3jfDVKnXs1ZoXTyy4/edit?usp=sharing&ref=blog.n8n.io), feel free to use it as a template when building this workflow. Make sure to have the same sheet and column names, as these are referenced in the nodes.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of my spreadsheet for reference.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/sheet-3.png)Setting up a spreadsheet in Google Sheets\n\n## Quickstart\n\nMany people want to experience the result before committing to a project and spending time. You can follow the steps below to get up and running quickly. To learn more about how each stage works, feel free to dig deeper into the sections below.\n\nNote that you will have to execute each node after configuration in order to view the correct data as it is being executed.\n\nHere are the quick start steps:\n\n  * Copy the n8n workflow from [here](https://n8n.io/workflows/730?ref=blog.n8n.io) and paste it in your n8n [Editor UI](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/glossary.html?ref=blog.n8n.io#editor-ui) (the workflow was build using n8n@0.111.0).\n  * Modify the following nodes in your workflow:\n  * **Typeform _(Attendee Registrations)_ **— [configure credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/typeform?ref=blog.n8n.io) and make sure to select your form in the _**Form**_ dropdown list.\n  * **Google Sheets _(Add to Sheets, Get Session Details)_** — [configure credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/google?ref=blog.n8n.io) and make sure to enter the **_Sheet ID_** for your sheet. The Sheet ID is the part of your Google Sheets URL between “d/” and “/edit”.\n  * **Mattermost _(Create Account, Add to channels)_ — **[configure credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/mattermost?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n  * **Mattermost (_Add to Team)_** — use the credentials you configured in the previous node and [enable email invitations](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/getting-started/managing-members.html?ref=blog.n8n.io#direct-invites) from the Mattermost System console.\n  * **Google Calendar _(Add to Event)_ — **[configure credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/google/?ref=blog.n8n.io) and create the events for each conference session in your calendar.\n  * **Gmail _(Welcome Email)_ — **[configure credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/google?ref=blog.n8n.io) and customize the message to your preference.\n\n\n\nYou should have a fully functioning workflow now. Let’s take a look at what each node does. You can change this workflow to better suit your needs.\n\nRemember to save and activate your workflow after you’re done!\n\n## The workflow\n\nNow that we have all the prerequisites ready to go, we can get started understanding and building your workflow.\n\nThis workflow can be divided into several stages, as it progresses from start to finish:\n\n  * Get Attendee Data\n  * Initialize Accounts\n  * Data Transformation\n  * Communication\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/workflow-breakdown.png) _The stages of the n8n conference workflow_\n\nLet’s work through setting up these stages in your n8n workflow.\n\n## Stage 1 — Get Attendee Data\n\n### Node 1 — Attendee Registrations\n\nIn n8n, every workflow begins with a trigger. It tells the workflow when to run and when to wait. We want the workflow to run whenever there is a new signup on your registration Typeform. We’ll use the [_Typeform Trigger_](https://n8n.io/integrations/n8n-nodes-base.typeformTrigger?ref=blog.n8n.io) node for this.\n\nConfigure your [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/typeform/?ref=blog.n8n.io) and select the name of your registration Typeform.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the Attendee Registrations node.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/Typeform-response.png)The Attendee Registrations node after execution\n\n### Node 2 — Add to Sheets\n\nIn this stage, we save the data from Typeform via a [_Google Sheets_](https://n8n.io/integrations/n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets?ref=blog.n8n.io) node so that we can easily access and manipulate this information for other processes outside of n8n, such as planning for emergencies, food and beverages, and seating allocations.\n\nConfigure your [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/google/?ref=blog.n8n.io), select the **_Append_** operation and enter your **_Sheet ID_**. Specify the **_Range_**. The range contains the column references corresponding to those on the spreadsheet. This tells the _Google Sheets_ node where to add the information we just received from the _Typeform_ node.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the Add to Sheets node.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/Google-sheets-response.png)The Add to Sheets node after execution\n\nHere’s a video of the steps I followed for Stage 1 of my workflow for reference.\n\nGetting Attendee data from Typeform and saving it to Google Sheets\n\n## Stage 2 — Initialize Accounts\n\n### Node 3 — Create Account\n\nThe [_Mattermost_](https://n8n.io/integrations/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost?ref=blog.n8n.io) node is used to automatically create a Mattermost user account for the attendees.\n\nConfigure your [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/mattermost/?ref=blog.n8n.io), then use the **_Create_** operation with the **_User_** resource to create a new user account for the attendees. Use the **_Email_** Auth Service in this step with the attendees’ email and a randomly generated password.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the Create Account node.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/mattermost-create-account.png)The Create Account node after execution\n\n### Node 4 — Add to Team\n\nMattermost organizes users into **_Teams_** , within which users can create channels to communicate with each other.\n\nWe already have a Mattermost account created and ready-to-go for your attendees from the previous step, we just need to add the user to the appropriate team.\n\nAdd another _Mattermost_ node and select the credentials you configured in the previous node. Select 'User' from the **_Resource_** dropdown list and 'Invite' from the **_Operation_** dropdown list.  \n\n\nOn your Mattermost System console, make sure that email invitations are enabled.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the Add to Team node.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/add-to-team.png)The Add to Team node after execution\n\nHere’s a video of the steps I followed for Stage 2 of my workflow for reference.\n\nStage 2 of the workflow being built\n\n## Stage 3 — Data Transformation\n\n### Node 5 — Array to Rows\n\nAt this stage, we have all the data we need and a ready-to-use Mattermost account for your attendees. Typeform returns the attendee registration data as an array of values in JSON string format. However, we need to make sure that the data is in a more usable JavaScript array format, as this is what n8n uses.\n\nTo transform the array values from Typeform into a more n8n friendly JavaScript array format, we will use the [_Function_](https://n8n.io/integrations/n8n-nodes-base.function?ref=blog.n8n.io) node to run the code below, which extracts every session the attendee selects during registration to a new JavaScript array.\n    \n    \n    const newItems = [];\n    for (let i=0;i<$node[\"Attendee Registrations\"].json[\"Which sessions would you like to attend?\"].length;i++) {\n    \tnewItems.push({\n        \tjson: {\n            \tSession: $node[\"Attendee Registrations\"].json[\"Which sessions would you like to attend?\"][i]\n            }\n         });\n    }\n    \n    return newItems;\n\nHere’s a quick comparison to demonstrate this.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*rAS1t_Y_aJRTCQtpff2TRQ.png)Data before function node![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*fqL2Ji52eqnnMoKO5swJQA.png)Data after function node\n\n### Node 6 — Get Session Details\n\nIn this stage, we read the data about the sessions that we entered in the Google Sheet during creation so that we can use it to get the relevant information personalized according to their form responses using the _[Merge](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/?ref=blog.n8n.io)_ node in the next step.\n\nConfigure your [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/google/?ref=blog.n8n.io), select the **_Read_** operation and enter your **_Sheet ID_**. Specify the **_Range_**. This tells the _Google Sheets_ node where to retrieve the information from.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the Get Session Details node.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*M91uTpaoLkrmW6RNtpQv7w.png)The Get Session Details node after execution\n\n### Node 7 — Merge Data\n\nThe _Merge_ node in this step does double-duty:\n\n  1. Combines the information about the attendees and sessions.\n  2. Removes any unnecessary information about sessions that the attendees did not select during registration, keeping only the data relevant to the attendees.\n\n\n\nConfigure your Merge node in the **_Merge By Key_** mode. This will combine all the information that is needed to notify the attendees.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the Merge Data node.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/merge-node.png)The Merge Data node after execution\n\nHere’s a video of the steps I followed for Stage 3 of my workflow for reference.\n\nStage 3 of the workflow being built\n\n## Stage 4 — Communication\n\n### Node 8 — Add to channels\n\nThis _Mattermost_ node adds the attendees to the appropriate channels for their sessions.\n\nConfigure your [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/mattermost/?ref=blog.n8n.io), then use the **_Add User_** operation with the **_Channel_** resource to add the attendee’s Mattermost accounts to the appropriate channels.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the Add to channels node.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*41z_vCq7LsNJlh5dwVoflQ.png)The Add to channels node after execution\n\n#### Node 9 — Add to Event\n\nTo share the meeting information and time, I scheduled events with Google Meet links on Google Calendar for each session. This [Google Calendar](https://n8n.io/integrations/n8n-nodes-base.googleCalendar?ref=blog.n8n.io) node adds the attendees to the appropriate Google Calendar events for their sessions.\n\nConfigure your [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/google/?ref=blog.n8n.io), then use the **_Update_** operation with the **_Event_** resource to add the attendees as invitees to the event. This will ensure that they get timely reminders and help prevent any conflict clashes.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the Add to Event node.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*Vr_kjJucZNtbWjW8SpEmLQ.png)The Add to Event node after execution\n\n#### Node 10 — Welcome Email\n\nThe final stage in this workflow — we send an email via the [Gmail](https://n8n.io/integrations/n8n-nodes-base.gmail?ref=blog.n8n.io) node to the attendees. In this message, I made sure to include a summary of the sessions they have signed up for, where to find the joining information and credentials to the Mattermost server.\n\nConfigure your [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/google/?ref=blog.n8n.io), then use the **_Send_** operation with the **_Message_** resource to send emails using the Gmail node.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the Welcome Email node.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*IyMUJtNG0oJQPjcXoKV9vQ.png)The Welcome Email node after execution\n\nHere’s a video of the steps I followed for Stage 4 of my workflow for reference.\n\nStage 4 of the workflow being built\n\nAnd that’s it! That’s the final piece!\n\nOnce the workflow is saved and activated, it will automatically repeat this process for every attendee of the conference.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of the message I received while running this workflow.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/03/0-HRmzQ-HkkPuQFm_l.png)Welcome email received after workflow execution is complete\n\n## What Now?\n\nNow that you’ve automated the sign-up process, you can start extending your workflow to include more features, such as adding a [Bannerbear](https://n8n.io/integrations/n8n-nodes-base.bannerbear?ref=blog.n8n.io) node to generate conference passes for each attendee. Another example of extending this workflow would be to use the [Twilio](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.twilio?ref=blog.n8n.io) node to automatically send SMS confirmation of registration.\n\nHowever, I decided to take a different route and created a companion workflow that automates feedback collection by sending a message after the end of the conference via Mattermost. You can take a look at that workflow over [here](https://n8n.io/workflows/731?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations! 🎉 You’ve successfully set up a Typeform, Google Sheets, Mattermost and automated the signup process for your conference using n8n to create accounts, send invites, and notify your attendees with a friendly welcome email.\n\nI’ve helped save countless hours using n8n and its powerful automation workflows to take the pressure off my team. I am constantly trying to use it and automate more facets of the conference such as certificate generation, event reminders, and email drip campaigns.\n\nWhich parts of your conference will you automate with n8n?\n\nI’d love to hear about what you’ve built using n8n!
