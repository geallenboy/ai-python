I started on desktop with Visual Basic 5 and Delphi 5 and then spent the last 14 years working with PHP/WordPress (last two years with Laravel) and the last nine years with Ruby on Rails.</p><p>In 2016 I started a company called <a href=\"https://powertic.com/en/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Powertic</a>, where I offer hosting and support for an open-source marketing automation system called <a href=\"https://www.mautic.org/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mautic</a>, where I still work today.</p><p>In open-source tools world, Iâ€™m responsible for organizing the official Mautic Meetups in SÃ£o Paulo and I am also a Community Leader and organize the official meetups for <a href=\"https://elementor.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elementor</a>, a famous page builder for WordPress.</p><p>I have always worked with education, conducting training courses and specialized courses in email marketing tools and system integration.</p><h2 id=\"how-and-why-did-you-start-using-n8n\">How and why did you start using n8n?</h2><p>My interest in the n8n started earlier this year, in February. I was looking to resolve customer dissatisfaction issues with the other automation tools pricing model, which we use to feed leads into Mautic and also manipulate the API. We usually enrich contacts and synchronize Mautic with a CRM as well.</p><p>In addition, Powertic has an Administrative Panel for Mautic and an email validation system called EmailFirst, which uses several n8n integrations: processing information in the background, index update, export of statics to MongoDB, manipulation of files on S3, etc.</p><p>Today most of our systems' background processing has been moved from Laravel's job system (Horizon) to n8n, where I can closely monitor performance and make improvements without having to rebuild my systems.</p><p>Given the problems of the pandemic, I started to look for work with n8n and I believe that this will be my main service in the coming years, as Brazil has a huge demand for open-source systems, especially in those systems that appeal to business data applications.</p><h2 id=\"have-you-tried-other-automation-tools-before\">Have you tried other automation tools before?</h2><p>During the development of the Powertic Panel and EmailFirst, I used <a href=\"https://github.com/huginn/huginn?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">huginn</a> and <a href=\"https://airbyte.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">airbyte</a>, but I needed to process and enrich information, standardize data, for example, and that's where I encountered many difficulties with these tools.</p><p><strong>The fact that n8n works directly with the raw data in JSON was the biggest attraction for installing and testing the tool</strong>, and the <em><a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Function</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Set</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ssh/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SSH nodes</a></em> were the factors to choose the tool.</p><p>Now talking about our customers, we spent a few years providing support and consulting for Zapier and Integromat. These tools solved some of our needs, like contacts synchronization and data enrichment, but we always ran into the limitations of components, and there's also the cost issue.</p><blockquote>Today, n8n is our biggest bet for this need for data synchronization between Mautic and several other systems.</blockquote><h2 id=\"what-kind-of-workflows-are-you-building-with-n8n\">What kind of workflows are you building with n8n?</h2><p>The biggest use case is Mautic's integration with CRM systems, email validation, contact enrichment by searching other databases or e-commerce information.</p><p>In addition to synchronization, I use MongoDB a lot to set up a small \"data lake\" with information that comes from different places (e.g., e-commerce, landing pages, zoom meetings, payment gateways) to keep a history of leads. I use this data from time to time to, for example, update information on leads on Mautic or score leads.</p><p>Mautic's API is very useful for several actions, but I've also been using NocoDB in my projects to have more freedom to do queries and inserts/updates in Mautic data (MySQL).</p><h2 id=\"which-integrations-do-you-use-the-most\">Which integrations do you use the most?</h2><p>I use MongoDB, Mautic, HubSpot a lot for lead integrations here at Powertic.
