We are inspired every day by the creative way in which people use n8n, in both their personal and professional life. The experiences and feedback from the past year show us that the world is ready for no-code and encourage us to continue on this path.</p><p><strong>Our strong belief is that in the future everyone will be a citizen developer.</strong></p><p>There‚Äôs still a long way to go in the workflow automation space and plenty of new ideas we want to implement. At this point, the new trust and resources invested into us allow us to pursue our mission of turning everyone into a citizen developer.</p><h2 id=\"what%E2%80%99s-next\">What‚Äôs next?</h2><p>What sets n8n apart from other workflow automation tools is more power and extensibility, letting you tweak every element of your workflow, dig down to the code, and add advanced logic, as well as our fair-code model and passionate community around it. This will continue to be our focus. </p><p>Specifically, the new funding round helps us pursue two main goals in the next months: <strong>growing our team</strong> with top talent and <strong>developing our product</strong> with new features.</p><blockquote><em>Jan is building a strong team with incredible momentum to bring n8n‚Äôs next-generation open workflow automation solution to a growing community of developers across multiple industries.</em><br><br>Aydin Senkut, Founder and Managing Partner of Felicis Ventures</blockquote><h3 id=\"growing-our-team\">Growing our team</h3><p>Only one year ago, we were four people brainstorming and working on n8n from a new office in Berlin.
