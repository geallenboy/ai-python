For example, in a business context, when getting feedback from customers on your product or service, you are more likely to keep in mind that one negative review over the other tens of praise messages. This bias can impact your perception of your work and the team spirit, so it's important to highlight the good news.</p>\n<p>For this use case, we built <a href=\"https://n8n.io/workflows/1109?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a workflow</a> that analyses the sentiment of feedback messages submitted via Typeform: messages with negative sentiment are added to a Trello board, while the ones with positive sentiment are added to a compliments table in Notion, then shared in a Slack channel. Looking once in a while at the impact you have on your customers is a wonderful way to keep your team motivated and inspired!</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/08/4.png\" alt=\"Workflow for feedback message analysis\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align=\"center\"><i>Workflow for feedback message analysis</i></figcaption></figure>\n<h3 id=\"add-memorable-articles-to-your-notion-reading-list\">Add memorable articles to your Notion reading list</h3>\n<p>The modern day reading list includes more than just books. <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/activity/posting/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Millions of blog posts</a>, news articles, and research papers are published every day, serving you information on how to solve problems, improve various skills, make informed decisions--or are just food for thought. You'll most probably stumble on some articles worth sharing or saving for a later (re-)read.</p>\n<p>To help you manage your reading list, we designed <a href=\"https://n8n.io/workflows/1110?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a workflow</a> that automatically adds important articles to a Notion page from Discord. When you type in <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discord the slash command</a>  <code>/[URL]</code>, with the URL of the article you want to save, the workflow extracts the article title and adds the linked title to the reading list in your Notion page. When all is done, you get a confirmation message on Discord: \"The link was added to Notion.\" Now you can focus only on reading and taking notes.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/08/5-1.png\" alt=\"Workflow for reading list management\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align=\"center\"><i>Workflow for reading list management</i></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next Steps</h2>\n<p>So, which workflow will you try first?

Imagine our excitement when we heard that [Notion launched their API (beta)](https://developers.notion.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io), thus opening new possibilities of using the app in a more personalised way!\n\n## Notion integration for automation\n\nOur developers got to work right away and [we launched](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/notion-n8n-integration?ref=blog.n8n.io) two of the most awaited nodes: [**Notion node**](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/?ref=blog.n8n.io#basic-operations) and [**Notion Trigger node**](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notionTrigger/?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n\nThe **Notion node** has five basic operations that allow you to manage blocks, get and query databases, create and update records in a database, create and search for pages, and get users who are part of your workspace.

In this article, we'll present to you **5 Notion workflows** you can automate in n8n:\n\n  1. Add candidates' profile assessment to Notion before an interview\n  2. Check to-do's in Notion and notify the assignee in Slack\n  3. Send notifications about new Notion notes to Mattermost\n  4. Add positive feedback messages to a compliments table in Notion\n  5.

[This workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1089?ref=blog.n8n.io) is triggered whenever new meeting notes are added in Notion. If the property field in the notes mentions the Marketing team, a message about the new notes will be sent to the Marketing channel in Mattermost, so all team members are up to date. Now you can enjoy your long-awaited coffee break knowing that the main action items will be taken care of.\n\n![Workflow for meeting notes updates](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/08/3-1.png)_Workflow for meeting notes updates_\n\n### Add positive feedback messages to a compliments table in Notion\n\nWe, humans, are prone to [negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias?ref=blog.n8n.io), meaning that we remember negative experiences more (strongly) than positive ones. For example, in a business context, when getting feedback from customers on your product or service, you are more likely to keep in mind that one negative review over the other tens of praise messages. This bias can impact your perception of your work and the team spirit, so it's important to highlight the good news.\n\nFor this use case, we built [a workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1109?ref=blog.n8n.io) that analyses the sentiment of feedback messages submitted via Typeform: messages with negative sentiment are added to a Trello board, while the ones with positive sentiment are added to a compliments table in Notion, then shared in a Slack channel. Looking once in a while at the impact you have on your customers is a wonderful way to keep your team motivated and inspired!\n\n![Workflow for feedback message analysis](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/08/4.png)_Workflow for feedback message analysis_\n\n### Add memorable articles to your Notion reading list\n\nThe modern day reading list includes more than just books. [Millions of blog posts](https://wordpress.com/activity/posting/?ref=blog.n8n.io), news articles, and research papers are published every day, serving you information on how to solve problems, improve various skills, make informed decisions--or are just food for thought. You'll most probably stumble on some articles worth sharing or saving for a later (re-)read.\n\nTo help you manage your reading list, we designed [a workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1110?ref=blog.n8n.io) that automatically adds important articles to a Notion page from Discord. When you type in [Discord the slash command](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands?ref=blog.n8n.io) `/[URL]`, with the URL of the article you want to save, the workflow extracts the article title and adds the linked title to the reading list in your Notion page. When all is done, you get a confirmation message on Discord: \"The link was added to Notion.\" Now you can focus only on reading and taking notes.\n\n![Workflow for reading list management](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/08/5-1.png)_Workflow for reading list management_\n\n## Next Steps\n\nSo, which workflow will you try first?
