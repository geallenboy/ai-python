  "readme": "> **Disclaimer:** I am in no way affiliated with or sponsored by [n8n](https://n8n.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io), I just like the product.\n\nMy name is [Karl Hughes](https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes?ref=blog.n8n.io), and I run [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev/?ref=blog.n8n.io), a technical content marketing agency. We recruit a lot of programmers who are also writers. One thing that I am doing is keeping an eye out for people who are writing good technical content and reaching out to them occasionally if I have a client who might benefit from their writing.\n\nI wanted to build an RSS reader that will pull in from various technical blogs and grab author information, if it’s there. With this, I can build up a [database of authors](https://github.com/draftdev/authors-collector?ref=blog.n8n.io) and the different topics they have written about on various blogs. That way, I can go through and recruit people based on their past writing history as I know that they are interested in these topics.\n\nI’ve been a proud Zapier customer for years. As a software developer, I knew how valuable automation could be, and[ now as a business owner](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer?ref=blog.n8n.io), it’s even more apparent. But, when I needed to build a custom RSS reader to create an author database, I reached for n8n, and here’s why.\n\n### Volume and frequency of tasks 📈\n\nZapier is a general-purpose tool, so you don’t have a ton of control over how frequently your tasks run. That makes sense because Zapier is hosting the zaps, and they have to balance all the tasks that they’re running for millions of users.\n\nThis application needs to collect data from dozens of RSS feeds and then index the topics of each piece of content. This is trivial to run as a [cron job](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cron/?ref=blog.n8n.io) on n8n, but to get a 1-minute polling frequency in Zapier, you’ll need to sign up for their $299/month team plan.\n\n### Backing up workflows ⚙️\n\nMy biggest gripe with Zapier over the years has been the inability to export or backup my workflows. The team features are nice, but they don’t help me if I want to move Zaps from one account to another or just keep a backup for peace of mind.\n\nn8n lets you export workflows, so if I ever need to set up multiple servers to run the same or similar workflows, I’ll be able to do it easily. I wish there were a way to check each version into GitHub automatically, but because my workflows don’t change that much once they’re set up, I’m getting by with manual backups for now.\n\n### Pricing 💸\n\nBefore diving into n8n, I ran the numbers in Zapier. Zapier’s prices have gone up three times since I started using the platform, so to get enough tasks to run this RSS feed collector, I’d need to pay at least $299/month. That’s prohibitively expensive for my small, open-source project that may never have a monetization strategy.\n\nWith n8n, I’m spending $20 per month ($10/month for a DigitalOcean droplet and $10/month for a managed database) and have more than enough hardware to scale up.\n\nIt also offers a [hosted version](https://www.n8n.cloud/?ref=blog.n8n.io), which is reasonably priced.\n\n### Fair-code license ⚖️\n\nI like the transparency of[ n8n’s open codebase](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n?ref=blog.n8n.io). While not technically “open-source”, I’ve had good luck posting issues and getting a quick response from their team.\n\n### My n8n workflows 🧰\n\nThis is the “Post Collector” workflow. I have a “sources” database table that it reads from. Then it gets the latest posts, transforms them into a standard format, and saves the posts to the database.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/0-0l6Cf5td-qq20gQU.jpg)The “Post Collector” workflow\n\nThis is the “Topic Collector” workflow. It uses a list of topics from StackOverflow to attach topics to each post based on the words used. For example, if an article mentions PHP, it will tag the post “PHP”. Using these two collectors, I now have a growing database of author names attached to topics, so when I want to recruit more writers, I just plug in my topics and search for them.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/0-TdoMzrCZKM0ZTecS.jpg)The “Topic Collector” workflow\n\n### Bring automation into your lives 🤖\n\nThe biggest thing is to make sure that you need automation because it can be a fair bit of work to set up the first time.
