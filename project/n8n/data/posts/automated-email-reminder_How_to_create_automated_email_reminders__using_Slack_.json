  "readme": "Imagine how easier your business routine could be when every time the invoice is issued, a new lead is added to the pipeline, or a new product is submitted to your online store, you get automatically notified. \n\nSuch automated notifications are especially useful when you need to receive critical business information in the quickest and most efficient possible way. \n\nIn this article, you will learn how to set up a highly customizable automated reminder and get notified whenever a specific event occurs using n8n, a[ workflow automation tool](https://n8n.io/pricing/?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n\nWe'll walk you through a few workflows for automated reminders and show you how to set them up with zero coding:  \n\n\n  * [Scheduling email reminders after a meeting](https://n8n.io/workflows/1221-create-a-pipedrive-activity-on-calendly-event-scheduled/?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n  * [Getting automated reminders when a Google Sheet is updated](https://n8n.io/workflows/404-notify-about-google-sheet-changes-in-slack-and-email/?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n  * [Getting notified via email about new invoices](https://n8n.io/workflows/1467-notify-on-new-emails-with-invoices-in-slack/?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n  * [Getting notified via Slack when a new product is added through WooCommerce](https://n8n.io/workflows/1458-notify-on-slack-when-new-product-is-added-in-woocommerce/?ref=blog.n8n.io)  \n\n\n\n\nWithout further ado, let’s get into it!\n\n## How do I automate reminders with n8n?\n\nWith the right tool, like n8n, a workflow automation platform, the possibilities of scheduling email reminders are up to your imagination.\n\nWhether you need an autoreminder for an upcoming Calendly meeting, a reminder to upgrade an account in Salesforce, or weekly reminders of your Medium stats, n8n could help. To do so, you can easily build a customized automated workflow in n8n that sends reminders for you.\n\nLong story short, in n8n, work is done through**[integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/?ref=blog.n8n.io) **which are also called nodes****(be it trigger nodes or regular nodes). The best part is that you have a plethora of integrations to choose from as well as a plethora of scenarios you can build by linking these integrations. \n\nNext, you might want to know about another important element in our workflow, namely **credentials.** To be more specific, you will use these credentials to authenticate the integrations in your workflow, whenever needed. \n\n**Requirements to follow along:**\n\n  * n8n — You can find details on how to install n8n on the [Quickstart](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/quickstart.html?ref=blog.n8n.io) page;\n  * Email account — You create an [account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?ref=blog.n8n.io) using Gmail, the most used email provider;\n  * Credentials for the integrations you'll use in your workflows.\n\n\n\nNow that the logic is all set, it's time to put automatic reminder emails to work!\n\n### Workflow 1: Schedule automatic email reminders after a meeting\n\nThis workflow would be useful for managing your meetings, namely when you want to remind the meeting participants to write down their notes and insights from the meeting.  \n\n\nWorry less by learning [how to use automated reminders after a meeting](https://n8n.io/workflows/1221-create-a-pipedrive-activity-on-calendly-event-scheduled/?ref=blog.n8n.io):\n\n![Workflow 1: Schedule automatic email reminders after a meeting](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/08/workflow-1.png)\n\n  \n**How it works:**  \n\n\nWhenever a meeting gets scheduled via Calendly, an activity is automatically created in Pipedrive, to remind the interviewer via Slack to write down notes from the meetings, 15 minutes after the meeting is over.  \n\n\n  1. [Calendly](https://n8n.io/integrations/calendly-trigger/?ref=blog.n8n.io): a meeting is scheduled;\n  2. [Pipedrive](https://n8n.io/integrations/pipedrive/?ref=blog.n8n.io): 15 minutes after the end of the meeting, it sends a message to the interviewer, reminding them to take notes on the meeting;\n  3. Email/[Slack](https://n8n.io/integrations/slack/?ref=blog.n8n.io): a message is sent to the user notifying them about the new entry.\n\n\n\n### Workflow 2: Get automated email reminders when a Google Sheet is updated\n\nThe good part is that in the next n8n automated workflow, you`ll learn how to receive a [notification whenever someone submits feedback in your Google Sheets document.](https://n8n.io/workflows/404-notify-about-google-sheet-changes-in-slack-and-email/?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n\n![Workflow 2: Get automated email reminders when a Google Sheet is updated](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/08/workflow-2.png)\n\n  \n**How it works:**  \n\n\nThis one is quite simple but very useful in the right context. Whenever a Google Sheet of importance to you gets updated, you will get a notification via Slack or Email.  \n\n\n  1. [Typeform](https://n8n.io/integrations/typeform-trigger/?ref=blog.n8n.io): a new form is submitted;\n  2. [Google Sheets](https://n8n.io/integrations/google-sheets/?ref=blog.n8n.io): collects and arranges the data according to set parameters;\n  3. Email/[Slack](https://n8n.io/integrations/slack/?ref=blog.n8n.io): a message is sent to the user notifying them about the new entry.\n\n\n\n### Workflow 3: Get notified via email about new invoices\n\nIf you are an account manager or your work involves dealing with invoices, this next workflow it`s just right for you. With this workflow, you (and other relevant people) [get notified when new emails containing the word “invoice” get to your inbox.](https://n8n.io/workflows/1467-notify-on-new-emails-with-invoices-in-slack/?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n\n![Workflow 3: Get notified via email about new invoices](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/08/workflow-3.png)\n\n  \n**How it works:**  \n\n\nThis workflow is programmed to check for new emails in a said mailbox for emails containing the word “invoice”. Invoice attachments are then sent to Mindee while a message is sent via Slack to let the team know a payment needs to be made.  \n\n\n  1. Checking for new emails in your inbox;\n  2. Emails containing the word “invoice”, get sent to [Mindee](https://n8n.io/integrations/mindee/?ref=blog.n8n.io);\n  3. Amounts > 1000(customizable value) get sent through email to the finance manager;\n  4. Relevant recipients get notified through [Slack](https://n8n.io/integrations/slack/?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n\n\n\n### Workflow 4: Get notified via Slack when a new product is added through WooCommerce\n\nNext, learn how to [automatically keep your Slack team up to date about new products added on WooCommerce.](https://n8n.io/workflows/1458-notify-on-slack-when-new-product-is-added-in-woocommerce/?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n\n![Workflow 4: Get notified via Slack when a new product is added through WooCommerce](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/08/workflow-4.png)\n\n**How it works:**  \n\n\nIf you like to be up to date, this workflow is automated to send a Slack notification(to a Slack channel) whenever a new product has been added on WooCommerce.  \n\n\n  1. A new product is added on [WooCommerce](https://n8n.io/integrations/woocommerce-trigger/?ref=blog.n8n.io) (trigger)\n  2. Your team gets notified via [Slack](https://n8n.io/integrations/slack/?ref=blog.n8n.io) (via your chosen channel).\n\n\n\n### Workflow 5: Receive SMS notifications for custom triggers  \n\n\nThis last workflow example works as a mini-content distribution system, namely an SMS notification system for a TikTok account (but it can be modified to notify followers of various types of content).  \n\n\nThere are three core user flows:\n\n  * Signup - the user signs up to get notified of new posts;\n  * Notify - user is notified by SMS when a new post is created;\n  * Unfollow - user removes themself from receiving future notifications.  \n\n\n\n\nEach tool has a specific purpose:\n\n  * [Notion](https://n8n.io/integrations/notion/?ref=blog.n8n.io): acts as a database\n  * [Tally](https://tally.so/?ref=blog.n8n.io): collects user input\n  * [n8n](https://n8n.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io): handles the logic for storing user data, sending notifications, and unfollowing  \n\n\n![Workflow 5: Receive SMS notifications for custom triggers](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2022/08/workflow-5.png)\n\n**How it works:**  \n\n\n  1. Signups - user signs up to get notified of new posts:\n\n\n  * Add followers via [webhook node](https://n8n.io/integrations/webhook/?ref=blog.n8n.io) from a Tally form submission;\n  * Set name & phone number;\n  * Add person to Notion database;\n  * Send signup confirmation SMS via [Twilio](https://n8n.io/integrations/twilio/?ref=blog.n8n.io).  \n\n\n\n\n2\\. Notifications - user is notified by SMS when a new post is created:\n\n  * Check for new posts;\n  * Notify the people in the Notion database;\n  * Get the TikTok link;\n  * Send SMS notification via [Twilio](https://n8n.io/integrations/twilio/?ref=blog.n8n.io).  \n\n\n\n\n3\\. Unfollows - user removes themself from receiving future notifications:\n\n  * Receive a response from Tally;\n  * Check for the “unfollow” word in the text;\n  * Find the said user in the Notion database;\n  * If true, remove user from the Notion followers database;\n  * Send unfollow SMS confirmation via [Twilio](https://n8n.io/integrations/twilio/?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n\n\n\n## Wrap up\n\nNow that you've taken a deep dive into workflow automation and saw how you can schedule email reminders automatically, it's time to put your imagination to work. Start building your own autoreminder, the one that fits best your needs!  \n\n\n**n8n gives you all the tools and resources you need, without having to know how to write a single line of code.**  \n\n\nLook over the [integrations list,](https://n8n.io/integrations/?ref=blog.n8n.io) drag and drop the apps you want to work with, customize them to match your ideal workflow and link them accordingly until you get the desired outcome.
