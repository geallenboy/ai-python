  "readme": "  \nAlmost exactly one year ago, I held my first workshop on NoCode automation in my team at the first company I worked for.\n\nLooking back, that was the starting point for me later to co-found [VisualMakers](https://www.visualmakers.de/?ref=blog.n8n.io) together with Alex - the online school for NoCode for the German speaking market. \n\nI not only realized how much fun it is to show others what is possible with NoCode, but also saw the potential for the first time how NoCode can literally inspire a team and every single employee.\n\n## 3 reasons why companies should adopt NoCode\n\nFrom my experience at VisualMakers, workshops, and conversation with no-code enthusiasts, I’ve identified three main reasons why companies should adopt no-code right away.\n\n### 1\\. NoCode empowers non-technical people to implement their ideas\n\nYou probably know this from yourself, or from conversations with other people: \"I couldn't code, it's way too complicated.\" The fear of breaking anything when faced with code (even if it's just the HTML text of an email) is real in any business.\n\nThis fear of people who lack an understanding of how software works makes them dependent on developers and their opinions, which in turn limits their ability to develop their own ideas for automated processes and digital products.\n\nThat changes completely with NoCode. With NoCode, anyone, technical background or not, can build their own processes or products.\n\nNo matter how savvy you are with programming languages - everyone can start their first automations with tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io), later on create more complex automations with [Integromat](https://www.visualmakers.de/tool/integromat?ref=blog.n8n.io) and then build completely individual workflows with [n8n](https://n8n.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n\n### 2\\. NoCode makes teams more creative and collaborative\n\nThe beauty of NoCode is that everyone can learn it. This improves communication within and between teams - everyone can have their say and contribute ideas, because everyone understands what is being talked about and quickly develops an understanding of what is possible.\n\nIn my experience, in all teams working with NoCode, the sense of responsibility for one's own work has improved enormously: there is much less talk about who’s responsible for what and above all, for what not. Instead, there is more collaboration, mutual help and working together instead of against each other.\n\nOf course, NoCode is not the panacea for every team culture - but I have experienced time and again that the playful approach to software has helped teamwork enormously - simply and alone because everyone develops a basic understanding of how software works with NoCode.\n\n### 3\\.  NoCode increases productivity and growth across teams\n\nNoCode helps teams save time and makes them more productive. You don’t have to wait for developers to program an application.\n\nSalespeople can build their own landing pages or automate their processes, marketers can better plan their content and automate workflows, accountants can automate the entire invoicing process - without writing a single line of code.\n\nWith NoCode skills, every employee is able to automate a good part of their work to some extent, thus boosting their individual and team productivity.\n\n## How to start adopting NoCode in your company\n\nNow that you’ve seen how no-code can benefit your company, it’s time to start implementing it in your team.\n\n### 1\\. Learn the basics of no-code\n\nIt takes some time and courage to break down the mental barrier of thinking that every click can break something. So the best way to start is by showing people how easy it is to connect different applications with NoCode tools like n8n.\n\nIn our experience, one of the best ways for this is a workshop. If you already have a team member  familiar with NoCode automation, you can ask them to host the workshop.\n\nOtherwise, experts from the NoCode scene can help out. We at VisualMakers offer different types of workshops, from NoCode basics to complex business automations,  in which we help you set up a productive workflow for your needs.\n\n[VisualMakers | Anleitungen, Online Kurse, Tutorials✅ Schritt für Schritt Tutorials und Anleitungen ✅ E-Mail Marketing ✅ Webseiten bauen ohne Programmierkenntnisse ✅ Sales Funnels ✅ Workflow Automatisierung![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ffee960322c890f9cc6e315/6005ad35c1e01503834e059a_Group%20118%20\\(2\\)%201Logo256.png)Anleitungen, Online Kurse, Tutorials![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ffee960322c890f9cc6e315/60488a7c0e90e14b1bb9d40b_OpenGraph-min.jpg)](https://www.visualmakers.de/kurse?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n\nFor those who want to dive deeper into the possibilities of NoCode, you can check out the VisualMakers online learning platform or take the n8n certification course.\n\n[Introduction | n8n Docsn8n is an extendable workflow automation tool that enables you to connect anything to everything via its open, fair-code model.Docs![](https://docs.n8n.io/assets/img/n8n-docs.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n\n### 2\\.
