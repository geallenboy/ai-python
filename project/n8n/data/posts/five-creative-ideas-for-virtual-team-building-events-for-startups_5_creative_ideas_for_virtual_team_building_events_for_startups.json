To get this started you need to set up teams of 2-3 people. Itâ€™s important that the team has mixed technical skill levels to ensure that everyone can build a product or automate processes. There are also many no-code tools available (e.g. n8n, Webflow, Airtable, MailChimp etc.) which make it possible to run the event for non-developers. In preparation, it is advisable to organise team meetings in advance to give everyone time to decide what to build or which processes to automate. There are many options, like building a dashboard to automatically track your KPIs or automating your customer onboarding processes.

You can play the game with up to 10 people. The game takes place on a spaceship where all crew members need to complete different tasks. Unfortunately, up to 3 team members are Impostors that sabotage and kill crew mates. The goal of the crew is to identify the Impostor(s); the goal of the Impostor(s) is to kill everyone before completing their tasks. Prep for this quick team event is pretty simple: You only need a video meeting and the Among Us app on your smartphone.

A constant high number of new joiners and a remote-first work culture are not the best circumstances for team building activities in startups. Luckily, there are still many opportunities to connect your remote team members without meeting in person.\n\nHere are five creative ideas for remote team building events for startups.\n\n## 1\\. One-Day Hackathon\n\nOrganise a one-day hackathon with your team to automate tasks or build low-code products.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/K5-S9nQrHTQkr55b1PYTP-6JGE2B72IrarvH-IJnFfpwGPE69H7i6gei7ekir0n2XLilw36APvajGvDWV4U7zx4Ip82ygimhwC_rhiH0El7c8FTnQs37__IUs1QwXYtgd6z3he5a)\n\nIf you want to bring your team together, enhance cross-functional collaboration, and increase your startup's efficiency at the same time, this is the must do event.

Presentation, celebration, and drinks.\n\n**Group size:** teams of 2-3, no limit for the number of teams\n\n**Duration:** whole day\n\n**Best for:** dev focused teams, cross-functional collaboration, mixed technical skill levels\n\n## 2\\.
