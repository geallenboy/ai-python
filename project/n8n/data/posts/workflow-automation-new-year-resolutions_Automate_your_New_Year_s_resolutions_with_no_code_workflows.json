Naw, I’m already paying for all these streaming services and I’m sure that I will find something to watch that won’t put me into a coma.\n\nSometimes, all it takes to get out of these ruts is a little nudge. A bit of a prod to move you closer where you know you should be mentally and physically.\n\nTo assist with this, I put together a list of **five workflows that can help you meet your New Year’s resolutions** and start you on some great new habits.\n\n#### Table of contents\n\nGet daily workout encouragement  \nTrack your (crypto) finances  \nGet healthy recipes emailed daily  \nGet new book recommendations  \nOrganize your tasks\n\n## Get daily workout encouragement\n\nThe most common resolution last year was doing more exercise. But after a long day of work, probably from home, it can be difficult to get motivated to get up and get moving. “Work out? I know I should, but I’d rather just sit here.. Who’s going to know anyway?”\n\nIf you use the[ Activity Encouragement](https://n8n.io/workflows/876?ref=blog.n8n.io) workflow, the answer is “at least three people”! This workflow monitors your[ Strava](https://www.strava.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io) account and checks if you have been active enough that day. If not, it will send an email to three of your friends, who will reach out to you with words of (we hope) encouragement!\n\n[![Screenshot of n8n workflow for workout motivation with Strava](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-10-at-10-26-52-n8n------JM-2021-resolutions.png)](https://n8n.io/workflows/876?ref=blog.n8n.io)Workflow for workout motivation with Strava\n\n## Track your (crypto) finances\n\nSaving more money is [the third most common New Year resolution](https://www.statista.com/statistics/378105/new-years-resolution/?ref=blog.n8n.io). An increasingly popular saving strategy is investing in cryptocurrency. But with its high volatility, you need an efficient way to automatically keep track of the ups and downs in your portfolio.\n\nThe[ Crypto Portfolio Tracking](https://n8n.io/workflows/859?ref=blog.n8n.io) workflow allows you to create an[ Airtable base](https://airtable.com/shrVzSe6GMNYsZ2Zx?ref=blog.n8n.io) that will update the value of your portfolio every hour.\n\n[![Screenshot of n8n workflow for tracking finances with CoinGecko](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-10-at-10-27-35-n8n------JM-2021-resolutions.png)](https://n8n.io/workflows/859?ref=blog.n8n.io)Workflow for tracking finances with CoinGecko\n\n## Get healthy recipes emailed daily\n\nMany of us want to start eating better in the new year. The holiday season tends to be a time when we allow ourselves to indulge in foods that may not be extremely healthy.\n\nThe challenge comes when trying to figure out what healthy meals to make. It is too easy to simply say, “I don’t know what to make for supper so I will eat this entire family-sized bag of potato chips instead!”.\n\nThe[ Daily Recipe Email](https://n8n.io/workflows/856?ref=blog.n8n.io) workflow allows you to configure what type of meals you would like to eat. It will then daily send you three recipes from[ Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io) so that you can pick up groceries on the way home and prepare a healthy meal.\n\n[![Screenshot of n8n workflow for getting emails with recipes](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-10-at-10-19-00-n8n------JM-2021-resolutions.png)](https://n8n.io/workflows/856?ref=blog.n8n.io)Workflow for getting emails with recipes\n\n## Get new book recommendations\n\nReading is one of the activities that can allow you to relax, destress, and improve yourself all at the same time. But what book should you read next? But sometimes you might find yourself in a reading slump because you just don’t know what to read next.\n\nA [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/869?ref=blog.n8n.io) that recommends books from the[ Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/?ref=blog.n8n.io) may just be what you are looking for! This workflow sends you an email every Friday with a book title, a brief description, and links to the authors so that you can look for more of their writing.\n\n[![Screenshot of n8n workflow for getting book recommendations](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-10-at-10-26-07-n8n------JM-2021-resolutions.png)](https://n8n.io/workflows/869?ref=blog.n8n.io)Workflow for getting book recommendations\n\n## Organize your tasks\n\nDo you ever feel like there is not enough time to do everything you need to do? Yeah, me too. Usually, this happens not because of a lack of time, but rather because of a lack of organization. Maybe a colleague told you to check something on your way to the coffee machine, but you completely forgot by the time you got back to the office, or got carried away with another task and couldn’t accomplish the new one by the end of the day.\n\n[This workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/865?ref=blog.n8n.io) can help you stay organized. It uses a[ Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io) web form to gather the information about the task request directly from the user, then categorizes it and assigns it in[ ClickUp](https://app.clickup.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io) accordingly.\n\n[![Screenshot of n8n workflow for organizing tasks in ClickUp](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/12/Screenshot-2021-12-10-at-10-17-21-n8n------JM-2021-resolutions-1.png)](https://n8n.io/workflows/865?ref=blog.n8n.io)Workflow for organizing tasks in ClickUp\n\n## Start automating\n\nIt is really easy for me to get into a routine that does not contribute to me being the best version of myself. I have found that little nudges from friends, family, and, yes, even computers can make a huge difference. They shake me out of my “lather, rinse, repeat” life so that I can pursue becoming the person I know that I can be. I hope that the five workflows presented in this post will do that for you as well.\n\n**Start automating your habits for free with the[n8n desktop app](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/?ref=blog.n8n.io#desktop-app), or use [n8n cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/?ref=blog.n8n.io) or the [self-hosted version](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/?ref=blog.n8n.io#self-hosting-n8n).**\n\nDo you have an amazing idea of how to make the New Year fantastic using n8n?
