I have been working for Goomer for the past five years, mostly as CSOps, an area where we focus on dedicated customer success operations.</p><p>We work to provide an efficient way for all teams to communicate. This communication is crucial when the customers move through the following path: marketing team, sales team, onboarding, and customer success. Our goal is that our customers can have a seamless experience during this process.</p><p>Goomer used to be a restaurant ordering system. Due to COVID-19, all the restaurants closed in Brazil. We ended up creating a delivery app, and all of our processes had to change as our product and needs had changed.</p><p>I have been working on automating these processes. We adopted n8n as our primary tool for doing this.</p><h2 id=\"what-made-you-decide-that-n8n-would-be-the-most-suitable-tool-for-you\"><strong>What made you decide that n8n would be the most suitable tool for you?</strong></h2><p>I have tried Zapier and Microsoft Flow before. Both are decent tools, but they lack the flexibility that we needed. Some services that we use are not available with these tools, and we have to add customizations on our end. Doing that manually for all the services became cumbersome quickly.</p><p>We are not a DevOps team, and our engineers are focused on delivering product updates. We cannot rely on software engineers to create our automation or deploy our tools.</p><p>When it comes to pricing, these tools become increasingly expensive, very fast.

That is where n8n came into play.</p><p>n8n was perfect for us. We took only a few minutes from our DevOps team to set up, and we were able to self-host it.

The cool thing is that we asked in the community forums for an improvement to the Coda node, and it got updated in less than a week. The n8n team rocks! 🤘</p><blockquote>I asked in the community forums for an improvement to the Coda node, and it got updated in less than a week.</blockquote><p>We are also using the webhook methods to create endpoints in n8n to trigger internal workflows coming from other systems.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-most-useful-feature-of-n8n-for-you\"><strong>What’s the most useful feature of n8n for you?</strong></h2><p>Every tool we pick to use at Goomer needs a triad of information: data, processes, and automation.

We cannot stop or delay major product features to integrate a new CRM or a marketing tag. The development roadmap is always tight, so we cannot always count on the DevOps team.

You have to keep this in mind: maintainability is crucial. That is an endless job.</p><h2 id=\"how-do-you-envision-using-n8n-in-the-near-future\"><strong>How do you envision using n8n in the near future?</strong></h2><p>Our goal is to have all of our Ops team using n8n to solve all issues they might have. Any small process that is manual or repetitive and can be automated will be. Just like Hubspot helps our team in many ways, n8n will do so too.</p><p>Processes like data ingestion, software integration, customer success workflows can and should be automated.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-a-feature-that-you-are-looking-forward-to-or-would-love-to-see-in-n8n\"><strong>What’s a feature that you are looking forward to or would love to see in n8n?</strong></h2><p>I would like to first thank you for the updates on the nodes we requested and the possibility to throttle requests for the HTTP Request node. These were things we wanted, and you already delivered, so thank you!</p><p>There’s always room for improvement. 🙂</p><p>Something I would like to have is workflow organization. We have over 200 workflows, so tagging or folders could be helpful. Having user control access would be great as well.</p><p>One last thing I would love to see is a separation between core nodes and regular nodes. The n8n core nodes are really useful, and I would like to know them better and easily identify them.</p><h2 id=\"any-parting-words-for-our-readers\"><strong>Any parting words for our readers?</strong></h2><p>Working with low-code/no-code applications is becoming a market standard. It’s the new “Office suite” in resumes. Being able to understand API documentation, how to interact with it, and explore resources is becoming valuable. It’s something we’re looking for when hiring new people. No-code/low-code is the future.</p><hr><p><em>n8n users come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

Learn about why Welley believes that low-code/no-code applications are becoming a market standard.\n\n## Can you tell me a bit about yourself?\n\nMy name is Welley Neto. I have been working for Goomer for the past five years, mostly as CSOps, an area where we focus on dedicated customer success operations.\n\nWe work to provide an efficient way for all teams to communicate. This communication is crucial when the customers move through the following path: marketing team, sales team, onboarding, and customer success. Our goal is that our customers can have a seamless experience during this process.\n\nGoomer used to be a restaurant ordering system. Due to COVID-19, all the restaurants closed in Brazil. We ended up creating a delivery app, and all of our processes had to change as our product and needs had changed.\n\nI have been working on automating these processes. We adopted n8n as our primary tool for doing this.\n\n## **What made you decide that n8n would be the most suitable tool for you?**\n\nI have tried Zapier and Microsoft Flow before. Both are decent tools, but they lack the flexibility that we needed. Some services that we use are not available with these tools, and we have to add customizations on our end. Doing that manually for all the services became cumbersome quickly.\n\nWe are not a DevOps team, and our engineers are focused on delivering product updates. We cannot rely on software engineers to create our automation or deploy our tools.\n\nWhen it comes to pricing, these tools become increasingly expensive, very fast. Free tiers were consumed in less than a week while testing, and we were running short on cash with the recent changes. So we could not afford these tools. That is where n8n came into play.\n\nn8n was perfect for us. We took only a few minutes from our DevOps team to set up, and we were able to self-host it. With predictable pricing in place, all we had to account for was server pricing. Also, being able to deploy it in our network allowed us to easily connect to databases and internal services without the hassle of tunnels, keys, and permissions.\n\n> Being able to easily deploy new workflows without having to wait for the DevOps team greatly improved our speed.\n\n## What kind of workflows are you building with n8n?\n\nI feel very proud of this workflow. Take a look.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2021/01/0-1tkJkIhWuTA4BeAG.png)\n\nThis little guy does a lot of magic for us!\n\nIt starts when we win a deal and gets recorded in our CRM.

That is an endless job.\n\n## **How do you envision using n8n in the near future?**\n\nOur goal is to have all of our Ops team using n8n to solve all issues they might have. Any small process that is manual or repetitive and can be automated will be. Just like Hubspot helps our team in many ways, n8n will do so too.\n\nProcesses like data ingestion, software integration, customer success workflows can and should be automated.\n\n## **What’s a feature that you are looking forward to or would love to see in n8n?**\n\nI would like to first thank you for the updates on the nodes we requested and the possibility to throttle requests for the HTTP Request node. These were things we wanted, and you already delivered, so thank you!\n\nThere’s always room for improvement. 🙂\n\nSomething I would like to have is workflow organization. We have over 200 workflows, so tagging or folders could be helpful. Having user control access would be great as well.\n\nOne last thing I would love to see is a separation between core nodes and regular nodes. The n8n core nodes are really useful, and I would like to know them better and easily identify them.\n\n## **Any parting words for our readers?**\n\nWorking with low-code/no-code applications is becoming a market standard. It’s the new “Office suite” in resumes. Being able to understand API documentation, how to interact with it, and explore resources is becoming valuable. It’s something we’re looking for when hiring new people. No-code/low-code is the future.\n\n* * *\n\n_n8n users come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.
