It was fascinating to me how a project can be built from people all over the world with different backgrounds and skill sets. I tried many times, however, never seemed to find a proper fit. The source codes were always too complex for me to understand, making it kind of overwhelming. I probably did not have enough experience back then.</p><p>I had been looking for a tool to automate a bunch of tasks I was doing manually every week at my job, but the tools I found were either not extensible or I could not afford them. In October 2019, I was scrolling through Product Hunt as I used to do every morning and found n8n. I saw the explainer video, and had an AHA moment. I immediately went to the project’s website, downloaded it, ran it locally, and started to play with it. It was love at first sight.</p><p>My first use-case was to read a bunch of emails from Google Sheets and send transactional emails with Mandrill. This is what I was doing manually with code every week and noticed n8n did not have a Mandrill node yet.

Also, the fact that n8n is written on NodeJS was a huge advantage as I had been working with NodeJS for the last 3 years. It took me a couple of weeks to craft that first node and send my first PR to the project. Once it got merged, after including feedback from Jan (CEO and founder of n8n), I got addicted to it.</p><p>After this first contribution, I began to work on nodes requested by the community and got a lot of positive feedback. The feeling that you get when you know you are providing value to the broader community got me even more hooked.

Here are some of the things that make me stick with n8n:\n\n  1. The source code was open to extending.\n  2. I could deploy whenever I wanted (it’s dockerized).\n  3.
