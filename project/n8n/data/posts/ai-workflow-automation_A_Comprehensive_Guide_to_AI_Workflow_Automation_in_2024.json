Here are some examples of how AI-powered automation tools, like those available in n8n, can be leveraged by developers:</p><h3 id=\"workflows-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag\">Workflows for retrieval augmented generation (RAG)</h3><p>Say you have an extensive knowledge base, such as internal documents, product specifications, or customer interaction history. With RAG workflows, LLMs can retrieve relevant information from your knowledge base and use it to create personalized and contextually accurate responses. This empowers you to create AI-powered applications that can answer questions, generate summaries, and even produce new content, all while maintaining contextual accuracy and relevance.</p><p>Let's break down the typical steps involved in a RAG workflow:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Knowledge base preparatio</strong>n</strong></li></ol><p>The process begins by breaking down your documents into smaller, manageable chunks and converting them into numerical representations called embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, allowing the LLM to compare and contrast different pieces of information effectively. The embeddings, along with their associated document chunks, are then stored in a vector database.</p><p><strong>2. <strong><strong>Query processing</strong></strong></strong></p><p>When a user submits a query, the system generates an embedding for that query and compares it against the embeddings in your knowledge base. The most similar embeddings, representing the most pertinent information, are then retrieved and provided to the LLM as context along with the original query.</p><p><strong>3. <strong>Response generation</strong></strong></p><p>The LLM then uses this additional context, along with the original query, to generate a response that is both accurate and contextually relevant.</p><p>n8n is a particularly powerful tool for building RAG workflows. It offers <a href=\"https://n8n.io/integrations/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a wide range of integrations</a>, allowing you to easily pull data from various sources, including popular vector databases such as <a href=\"https://n8n.io/integrations/qdrant-vector-store/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Qdrant</a>. Additionally, <a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/langchain/langchain-n8n/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">n8n leverages LangChain</a> under the hood, providing a visual interface for defining and orchestrating RAG workflows, making it an accessible and easy-to-use solution.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><div class=\"js-reframe\" style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.5%;\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UeFi5oV9UpY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Step-by-Step Tutorial: Create a RAG Chatbot with n8n AI Agents in MINUTES\" style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0px; top: 0px;\"></iframe></div></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">💡</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">The <a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/starter-kits/ai-starter-kit?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI starter kit</a> is the perfect starting point for creating RAG workflows using n8n.</div></div><h3 id=\"workflows-for-chatbots-virtual-assistants\">Workflows for chatbots &amp; virtual assistants</h3><p>AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are transforming the way businesses interact with customers and employees. These intelligent agents can handle a wide range of tasks, from answering simple questions to guiding users through complex processes. By automating these interactions, you can improve response times, reduce costs, and free up human agents to focus on more strategic work.</p><p>Let's break down the key components that power LLM-driven chatbots:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>User interface (UI)</strong></strong></li></ol><p>This is the front-end of the chatbot, where users interact with the system. It can be a simple text-based interface, a graphical interface with buttons and menus, or even a voice-activated interface. The UI is responsible for capturing user input, displaying the chatbot's responses, and providing an intuitive user experience.</p><p><strong>2. <strong>Orchestrator</strong></strong></p><p>This component acts as the brain of the chatbot, coordinating the different components involved in generating responses. It receives user input from the UI and interacts with external systems, such as databases or APIs, to retrieve additional information or perform specific tasks on the user's behalf.</p><p><strong>3. <strong>Large language model (LLM)</strong></strong></p><p>LLMs are responsible for understanding user input and generating natural language responses. They are trained on massive datasets of text and code, enabling them to understand the nuances of human language and generate responses that are both contextually relevant and informative. They can be fine-tuned or adapted to specific domains or tasks, allowing them to provide more accurate and personalized responses.</p><p>n8n is an ideal platform for crafting these chatbot workflows, offering a comprehensive toolkit and handling all three components required to build them. It can orchestrate workflows and integrate with various data sources.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script>\n  workflowBanner([2325, 1961], document.currentScript, { \n      workflowsHeader: \"AI

Here are some examples of how AI-powered automation tools, like those available in n8n, can be leveraged by developers:\n\n### Workflows for retrieval augmented generation (RAG)\n\nSay you have an extensive knowledge base, such as internal documents, product specifications, or customer interaction history. With RAG workflows, LLMs can retrieve relevant information from your knowledge base and use it to create personalized and contextually accurate responses. This empowers you to create AI-powered applications that can answer questions, generate summaries, and even produce new content, all while maintaining contextual accuracy and relevance.\n\nLet's break down the typical steps involved in a RAG workflow:\n\n  1. ****Knowledge base preparatio** n**\n\n\n\nThe process begins by breaking down your documents into smaller, manageable chunks and converting them into numerical representations called embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, allowing the LLM to compare and contrast different pieces of information effectively. The embeddings, along with their associated document chunks, are then stored in a vector database.\n\n**2.****Query processing******\n\nWhen a user submits a query, the system generates an embedding for that query and compares it against the embeddings in your knowledge base. The most similar embeddings, representing the most pertinent information, are then retrieved and provided to the LLM as context along with the original query.\n\n**3.**Response generation****\n\nThe LLM then uses this additional context, along with the original query, to generate a response that is both accurate and contextually relevant.\n\nn8n is a particularly powerful tool for building RAG workflows. It offers [a wide range of integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/?ref=blog.n8n.io), allowing you to easily pull data from various sources, including popular vector databases such as [Qdrant](https://n8n.io/integrations/qdrant-vector-store/?ref=blog.n8n.io). Additionally, [n8n leverages LangChain](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/langchain/langchain-n8n/?ref=blog.n8n.io) under the hood, providing a visual interface for defining and orchestrating RAG workflows, making it an accessible and easy-to-use solution.\n\n💡\n\nThe [AI starter kit](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/starter-kits/ai-starter-kit?ref=blog.n8n.io) is the perfect starting point for creating RAG workflows using n8n.\n\n### Workflows for chatbots & virtual assistants\n\nAI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are transforming the way businesses interact with customers and employees. These intelligent agents can handle a wide range of tasks, from answering simple questions to guiding users through complex processes. By automating these interactions, you can improve response times, reduce costs, and free up human agents to focus on more strategic work.\n\nLet's break down the key components that power LLM-driven chatbots:\n\n  1. ****User interface (UI)****\n\n\n\nThis is the front-end of the chatbot, where users interact with the system. It can be a simple text-based interface, a graphical interface with buttons and menus, or even a voice-activated interface. The UI is responsible for capturing user input, displaying the chatbot's responses, and providing an intuitive user experience.\n\n**2.**Orchestrator****\n\nThis component acts as the brain of the chatbot, coordinating the different components involved in generating responses. It receives user input from the UI and interacts with external systems, such as databases or APIs, to retrieve additional information or perform specific tasks on the user's behalf.\n\n**3.**Large language model (LLM)****\n\nLLMs are responsible for understanding user input and generating natural language responses. They are trained on massive datasets of text and code, enabling them to understand the nuances of human language and generate responses that are both contextually relevant and informative.

website or app, consider the [n8n chat widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat?ref=blog.n8n.io). It delivers a ready-to-use UI that is customizable and works well with any type of web application. n8n lets you choose from popular cloud-based LLMs like [OpenAI’s GPT](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/?ref=blog.n8n.io) or [Google’s Gemini](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgooglegemini/?ref=blog.n8n.io), or you can use open-source LLMs with [n8n’s Ollama integration](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatollama/?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n\n💡\n\nCheck out this article to [learn more about self-hosting LLMs with n8n and Ollama](https://blog.n8n.io/local-llm/).\n\n### Workflows for data extraction & analysis\n\nThese workflows leverage AI's ability to understand and interpret data, even in unstructured formats, to extract information and identify patterns.\n\nLet's break down the typical steps involved in a data extraction and analysis workflow:\n\n  1. ****Data collection****\n\n\n\nThe first step is to gather data from various sources, which could include databases, APIs, cloud storage, or even unstructured documents like PDFs and images.\n\n**2.**Data processing****\n\nRaw data is rarely ready for analysis. This step involves cleaning and preparing the data, which might include handling missing values, converting data types, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis. AI can help automate these tasks, ensuring data quality and consistency.\n\n**3.**Data analysis****\n\nThis is where AI truly shines! Machine learning algorithms can analyze the preprocessed data to identify trends, patterns, anomalies, and other valuable insights.\n\nn8n’s [extensive library of integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/?ref=blog.n8n.io) allows you to connect to virtually any data source, and its visual workflow editor makes it easy to design and automate your data processing pipelines. And when it comes to using AI to analyze the data, n8n integrates seamlessly with various AI and machine learning platforms, providing the tools you need to turn raw data into insights.\n\n### AI data

AI-powered automation workflows together! \n\nImagine your workflow involves validating passports. This n8n workflow uses multimodal LLMs with AI vision to check if user-submitted portraits meet the criteria for valid passport photos. This automates a task that would be difficult to code and time-consuming for humans to do at scale.\n\n![n8n image validation workflow using Google Gemini AI model](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2024/09/image-workflow.webp)n8n image validation workflow using Google Gemini AI model\n\nIn this example, the workflow analyzes a set of portraits to verify if they meet the criteria for valid passport photos according to the UK government website.\n\n______![Split Out](data:image/svg+xml;base64,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)![Google Drive](data:image/svg+xml;base64,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) +4\n\n[Automate Image Validation Tasks using AI Vision](https://n8n.io/workflows/2420-automate-image-validation-tasks-using-ai-vision/)\n\nby jimleuk\n\n[ Use this workflow ](https://n8n.io/workflows/2420-automate-image-validation-tasks-using-ai-vision/)\n\n### Step 1: Import photos to validate\n\nThis workflow is [triggered manually](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger?ref=blog.n8n.io), however, feel free to use any type of workflow trigger that suits your use case.\n\nManually set workflow data using the [Edit Fields node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set?ref=blog.n8n.io) \\- in this case a list of image URLs. Set the **Mode** to _Manual Mapping_ and paste an array of photos with names and Google Drive URLs into the data field. Ensure the data type is set to _Array_.\n\n![workflow data input using the Edit Fields node](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2024/09/data-input-node.webp)workflow data input using the Edit Fields node\n\nHere is an example of the JSON data structure used as input:\n    \n    \n    {{\n    [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"portrait_1\",\n      \"url\": \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zs963iFkO-3g2rKak8Hcy555h55D8gjF/view?usp=sharing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"portrait_2\",\n      \"url\": \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19FyDcs68dZauQSEf6SEulJMag51SPsFy/view?usp=sharing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"portrait_3\",\n      \"url\": \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gbXjfNYE7Tvuw_riFmHMKoqPPu696VfW/view?usp=sharing\",\n    \n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"portrait_4\",\n      \"url\": \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s19hYdxgfMkrnU25l6YIDq-myQr1tQMa/view?usp=sharing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"portrait_5\",\n      \"url\": \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/193FqIXJWAKj6O2SmOj3cLBfypHBkgdI5/view?usp=sharing\"\n    }\n    ]\n    }}\n    \n\n### Step 2: Download and resize images\n\nProcess each image individually using the [Split Out node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n\n![split out fields from array](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2024/09/split-out-node.webp)split out fields from array\n\nThen, using the [Google Drive node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive?ref=blog.n8n.io), download all the files for local processing.\n\n![Google Drive download node](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2024/09/google-drive-download-node.webp)Google Drive download node\n\nResize images before sending them to the AI model for easier processing and to avoid file size limits. This is extremely easy to do with the [Edit Image node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.editimage?ref=blog.n8n.io). It seems n8n has a node for everything!\n\n![resize images node](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2024/09/resize-images-node.webp)resize images node\n\nFrom the **Operation** dropdown, choose _Resize. U_ se _1024_ by _1024_ pixels and choose _Only if Larger_ from the **Options** dropdown. \n\n### Step 3: Verify passport photo using Google Gemini\n\nNow for the AI magic! We'll use [n8n's Basic LLM Chain node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm?ref=blog.n8n.io) to define the prompt that our AI will use to evaluate the photos. This node allows you to craft the instructions and context that guide the AI's analysis.\n\nTo start, select **Define Below** from the **Prompt** dropdown. This gives you direct control over the prompt's content. We'll provide two types of prompts: a system prompt and a user prompt.\n\n![n8n Basic LLM Chain node](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-28-194422.webp)n8n Basic LLM Chain node\n\nTo add a system prompt, choose _System_ from the **Type Name or ID** dropdown and paste in the following prompt in the **Message __** input:\n    \n    \n    You help verify passport photo validity.\n    \n    ## Rules for digital photos\n    https://www.gov.uk/photos-for-passports\n    \n    ### The quality of your digital photo\n    Your photo must be:\n    * clear and in focus\n    * in colour\n    * unaltered by computer software\n    * at least 600 pixels wide and 750 pixels tall\n    * at least 50KB and no more than 10MB\n    \n    ### What your digital photo must show\n    The digital photo must:\n    * contain no other objects or people\n    * be taken against a plain white or light-coloured background\n    * be in clear contrast to the background\n    * not have ‘red eye’\n    * If you’re using a photo taken on your own device, include your head, shoulders and upper body. Do not crop your photo - it will be done for you.\n    \n    In your photo you must:\n    * be facing forwards and looking straight at the camera\n    * have a plain expression and your mouth closed\n    * have your eyes open and visible\n    * not have hair in front of your eyes\n    * not have a head covering (unless it’s for religious or medical reasons)\n    * not have anything covering your face\n    * not have any shadows on your face or behind you - shadows on light background are okay\n    * Do not wear glasses in your photo unless you have to do so. If you must wear glasses, they cannot be sunglasses or tinted glasses, and you must make sure your eyes are not covered by the frames or any glare, reflection or shadow.\n    \n    ### Photos of babies and children\n    * Children must be on their own in the picture. Babies must not be holding toys or using dummies.\n    * Children under 6 do not have to be looking directly at the camera or have a plain expression.\n    * Children under one do not have to have their eyes open. You can support their head with your hand, but your hand must not be visible in the photo.\n    * Children under one should lie on a plain light-coloured sheet. Take the photo from above.\n    \n\nNow for the user prompt, click the **Add prompt** button and select _User_ from the **Type Name or ID** dropdown. Use the _Image (Binary)_ **Message Type** to send the image to the LLM. Use the `data` field from the previous node in the **Image Data Field Name** input.\n\nBefore moving on, make sure to toggle **Require Specific Output Format** to _on_. We'll configure a custom output formatter in the next step to make the AI's response easy to use.\n\nFinally, add the [Google Gemini node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgooglegemini?ref=blog.n8n.io) as the AI model for the LLM chain. Pick whichever Gemini variant best suits your needs.\n\nBut don't feel limited to Gemini! n8n allows you to connect to a variety of LLMs, including those from OpenAI and even open-source models with n8n's Ollama integration. Experiment to find the best fit for your use case and data.\n\n### Step 4: Format output\n\nFormatting the output is essential, especially if you plan on sending the output of the LLM to an API or other n8n workflows. In such cases, having a consistent schema for the output is necessary.\n\nWe can use the [Structured Output Parser node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured?ref=blog.n8n.io) to define the schema for the LLM response.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2024/09/output-parser.webp)LLM output parser node\n\nYou can use the following schema that defines a field called `is_valid` as well as a `description` of the photo:\n    \n    \n    {\n    \t\"type\": \"object\",\n    \t\"properties\": {\n    \t\t\"is_valid\": { \"type\": \"boolean\" },\n            \"photo_description\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"description\": \"describe the appearance of the person(s), object(s) if any and the background in the image. Mention any colours of each if possible.\"\n            },\n    \t\t\"reasons\": {\n              \"type\": \"array\",\n              \"items\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n            }\n    \t}\n    }\n    \n\n### Create your first AI workflow with n8n\n\nBuild custom AI apps in minutes for your business operations\n\n[Try n8n now](https://app.n8n.cloud/register?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n\n## Wrap Up\n\nIn this article, we've explored the power of AI workflow automation to transform the way you work. We've seen how AI can handle unstructured data, adapt to change, and free up your team to focus on high-value tasks.\n\nWe've also looked at five leading AI workflow automation tools: n8n, Zapier, Make, Microsoft Power Automate and UiPath.\n\nThen we explored different types of AI workflows such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), chatbots & virtual assistants, and data extraction & analysis.\n\nFinally, we walked through an example of a multimodal AI workflow using n8n and Google Gemini to validate passport photos, demonstrating the power of AI to automate complex, real-world tasks.\n\nThis is just the beginning! As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more innovative and transformative applications of AI in workflow automation.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nExplore n8n's extensive capabilities and discover how you can build even more powerful and customized AI-powered workflows.
