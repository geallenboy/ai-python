We plan to expand the library gradually, bringing even more verified nodes into the editor along with the powerful and creative use cases they unlock.

You can find guidelines for community node verification and other resources you need to get started in the <a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>community nodes documentation</u></a>.</div></div><h2 id=\"why-we%E2%80%99re-investing-in-the-ecosystem\">Why we’re investing in the ecosystem</h2><p>As n8n grows, so does the demand for more integrations, especially with long-tail, domain-specific, and specialized tools. Community-published nodes have helped meet this challenge, giving users increased functionality. For example, contributions on npm for <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-lavatop?ref=blog.n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>lava.top</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-shortio?ref=blog.n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Short.io</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-ticktick?ref=blog.n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TickTick</strong></a> have enabled flowgrammers to monetize content, create branded URLs, and better manage tasks and deadlines.</p><p>There are already nearly 2,000 community nodes published on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3An8n-community-node-package&amp;ref=blog.n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">npm</a>, with over 8 million downloads to date. That’s a clear sign of how essential these integrations are for supporting the diverse automation needs of the n8n community. Until now, this power was limited to self-hosted users. Even then, it required manual setup that made it harder to take full advantage. That changes today. </p><p>With the ability for n8n Cloud users to access third-party nodes, we're taking another step towards enabling a thriving, extensible ecosystem where anyone can contribute new functionality and share it easily with others. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/05/download-graph-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1750\" height=\"846\" srcset=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/download-graph-2.png 600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/download-graph-2.png 1000w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/download-graph-2.png 1600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/05/download-graph-2.png 1750w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://n8engine.com/community-nodes/ecosystem?ref=blog.n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Source: n8nengine.com (2025)</span></a></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-huge-thanks-to-the-builders\">A huge thanks to the builders</h2><p>To everyone who has built and published a community node – <strong>thank you</strong>. You’ve gone out of your way to solve real problems, share your expertise, and make n8n better for everyone. Empowering others has always been part of the n8n spirit, and your contributions reflect the generosity and creativity that define this community.

Together, they power use cases from automating web interactions and extracting structured data, to streamlining communications, and enhancing meeting productivity. </p><p>To show what this looks like in practice, here’s a closer look at a few partners and the real-world scenarios they can address.</p><h3 id=\"spotlight-elevenlabs\"><strong>Spotlight: ElevenLabs</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>ElevenLabs</u></strong></a> builds AI audio that sounds natural, works in 32 languages, and runs in real time.</p><p>ElevenLabs’ tools are used to localize content, voice game characters, generate dynamic narration, and prototype audio for everything from education and customer service to entertainment. Teams use them to train medical staff, power voice assistants, test call centre flows, or support people who’ve lost their voice due to illness.</p><p>With the ElevenLabs node in n8n, you can now automate these kinds of voice-powered workflows directly in the editor - without workarounds or custom code. It’s a fast, flexible way to bring speech into the tools and systems you already use.</p><p><em>\"We wanted developers to be able to build voice-powered workflows without jumping through hoops. The node makes that possible. It’s a clean, fast way to bring speech into automation — whether you’re restoring a voice or just adding sound to something new\" </em>says Louise Meyer-Schoenherr, Customer Success, ElevenLabs.</p><h3 id=\"spotlight-serpapi\"><strong>Spotlight: SerpApi</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://serpapi.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>SerpApi</u></strong></a> aims to build the best APIs in the world for all the top search engines, enabling users to scrape and parse results as a human would see them on Google, Bing, Baidu, Yahoo, Yandex, Ebay, Google Maps and more.</p><p>Just like its core product stack, the SerpApi n8n community node offers the same robust features and includes ready-built integrations for the top 20+ search engines, including Google Search, Shopping, Images, Maps, and News.</p><p>The use cases for the SerpApi community node range from LLM training and building AI chat bots, to monitoring SEO, prices, and competitor reviews. SerpApi Customer Success Engineer Alex Barron even built an AI travel agent.</p><p>Alex explained: <em>“We often help users who can’t write code, but they can think logically and have a vision for what they want to build. Some were already using SerpApi through n8n with the standard HTTP node, but were finding it too complicated. We wanted to build integrations that would make it easier for them to bring their vision to life, and contributing a community node to n8n was the ideal way to help more users across the globe.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p>While SerpApi is launching the community node with their most popular search engine APIs, you can still use their standard HTTP library for other APIs. The team is also always open to user feedback and plans to add support for more features and APIs in the future.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/05/serp-screenshot-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1265\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/serp-screenshot-2.png 600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/serp-screenshot-2.png 1000w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/05/serp-screenshot-2.png 1265w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"spotlight-brave-coming-soon\"><strong>Spotlight: Brave (coming soon)</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://search.brave.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>Brave Search</u></strong></a> is the world’s most complete, independent, search engine, with a depth of results and ranking quality that rivals Big Tech. The Brave Search API n8n community code is an extension of the Brave Search API, a powerful developer tool for building apps that can programmatically search the web.&nbsp;</p><p>The Brave Search n8n community node provides the most important service level implementations for all major request types, so you can seamlessly request images, news, videos, and websites. Plus, there’s plans in the works to introduce more configurations for even greater precision with queries</p><p>“<em>As AI use is growing across the web, more and more people are wanting to integrate intelligent&nbsp; features into their projects. One area that LLMs fall short is real-time data. Leveraging the Brave Search API significantly increases AI effectiveness by grounding LLM responses in context-rich information from the Web. We’re working hard to introduce more ways for developers to build with the power of the web, including expanding the capabilities of our community node in n8n.”&nbsp;</em>- Sampson, Senior Developer Relations at Brave Search </p><p>The possibilities with the node are endless, from fetching localized insights, to completely replicating the way that human users search the web with AI agents. At a recent hackathon, one user leveraged the node to feed real-time data to an NPC. When other players would ask questions, the NPC could respond with live data, discussing topical issues in human speech like the recent papal conclave or newly released movies.</p><h2 id=\"ready-to-try-it\"><strong>Ready to try it?</strong></h2><p>Whether you're building workflows or building nodes, here’s how to get started:</p><h3 id=\"for-users\"><strong>For users:</strong></h3><p>Instance owners can install verified community nodes by opening the editor, heading to the Nodes panel and searching for a node by name.

  "readme": "We’re expanding the n8n ecosystem and unlocking a new level of flexibility for all users. Starting today, a select set of community nodes and partner integrations are available directly from the canvas, including for those on n8n Cloud!\n\nThis means you can now discover, install, and automate with a wider range of integrations without leaving your workspace. The power of the community is now built-in, and this is just the beginning.\n\nTo access these nodes, make sure you've [updated to version 1.94.0](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/update-cloud-version/?ref=blog.n8n.io) or later.\n\n## What’s new in this release\n\nThis update focuses on three major improvements:\n\n  * **Cloud availability** : Community nodes are no longer just for self-hosted users. A select set of nodes is now available on n8n Cloud. \n  * **Built-in discovery** : You can find and explore these nodes right from the Nodes panel without leaving the canvas or searching on npm.\n  * **Trust and verification** : Nodes that appear in the editor have been manually vetted for quality and security. These verified nodes are marked with a shield icon.\n\n\n\nWe’re starting with a selection of around 25 nodes, including some of the most-used community-built packages and partner-supported integrations. For this phase, we focused on nodes that use the MIT license and don’t include external package dependencies - helping streamline the review process and ensure a smooth rollout. \n\nThis is just the start. We plan to expand the library gradually, bringing even more verified nodes into the editor along with the powerful and creative use cases they unlock. In time, our criteria will evolve, opening the door to a wider range of contributions while keeping quality and security in focus.\n\n💡\n\nIf you’re interested in building a new node, or want to have an existing one verified and accessible from the canvas, now’s a great time to get involved. You can find guidelines for community node verification and other resources you need to get started in the [_community nodes documentation_](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n\n## Why we’re investing in the ecosystem\n\nAs n8n grows, so does the demand for more integrations, especially with long-tail, domain-specific, and specialized tools. Community-published nodes have helped meet this challenge, giving users increased functionality. For example, contributions on npm for [**lava.top**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-lavatop?ref=blog.n8n.io), [**Short.io**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-shortio?ref=blog.n8n.io), and [**TickTick**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-ticktick?ref=blog.n8n.io) have enabled flowgrammers to monetize content, create branded URLs, and better manage tasks and deadlines.\n\nThere are already nearly 2,000 community nodes published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3An8n-community-node-package&ref=blog.n8n.io), with over 8 million downloads to date. That’s a clear sign of how essential these integrations are for supporting the diverse automation needs of the n8n community. Until now, this power was limited to self-hosted users. Even then, it required manual setup that made it harder to take full advantage. That changes today. \n\nWith the ability for n8n Cloud users to access third-party nodes, we're taking another step towards enabling a thriving, extensible ecosystem where anyone can contribute new functionality and share it easily with others. \n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/05/download-graph-2.png)[Source: n8nengine.com (2025)](https://n8engine.com/community-nodes/ecosystem?ref=blog.n8n.io)\n\n## A huge thanks to the builders\n\nTo everyone who has built and published a community node – **thank you**. You’ve gone out of your way to solve real problems, share your expertise, and make n8n better for everyone. Empowering others has always been part of the n8n spirit, and your contributions reflect the generosity and creativity that define this community. Your work has helped unlock countless automation possibilities for users around the world.\n\nWe also want to give a shout-out to the partners who’ve already added integrations as well as those still considering it. We’re excited to collaborate with you and bring even more value to our shared users.\n\n## New power from partners, right from the canvas\n\nIt’s easier than ever to automate with nodes from brands you know, and to discover new tools you've yet to explore. \n\nWhether you’re enriching AI agents with structured data from [**Tavily**](https://tavily.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io), verifying the quality of language translations with [**Straker**](https://www.straker.ai/?ref=blog.n8n.io), or generating beautiful PDF reports with [**pdforge**](https://pdforge.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io) – these integrations are built to unlock serious capability. Automate large-scale data collection through****[**Bright Data**](https://brightdata.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io), protect your organization with [**SOCRadar**](https://socradar.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io)’s digital risk and threat intelligence tools, create realistic avatar video agents with [**Beyond Presence**](https://www.beyondpresence.ai/?ref=blog.n8n.io), boost LinkedIn engagement with [**Browserflow**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/browserflow-io/?ref=blog.n8n.io), or generate QR codes and get image metadata with [**Mallabe**](https://www.mallabe.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io).\n\nThese are just a few examples of what’s already possible. You’ll also find nodes supported by [**Chat Data**](https://www.chat-data.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io), [**Easy Redmine**](https://www.easyredmine.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io), [**KlickTipp**](https://www.klicktipp.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io), [**Parsera**](https://parsera.org/?ref=blog.n8n.io), [**ScrapeGraphAI**](https://scrapegraphai.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io),****[**Signify**](https://www.signifycrm.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io),**** and****[**Vikunja**](https://vikunja.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io) – all available to install directly from the editor. Together, they power use cases from automating web interactions and extracting structured data, to streamlining communications, and enhancing meeting productivity. \n\nTo show what this looks like in practice, here’s a closer look at a few partners and the real-world scenarios they can address.\n\n### **Spotlight: ElevenLabs**\n\n[** _ElevenLabs_**](https://elevenlabs.io/?ref=blog.n8n.io) builds AI audio that sounds natural, works in 32 languages, and runs in real time.\n\nElevenLabs’ tools are used to localize content, voice game characters, generate dynamic narration, and prototype audio for everything from education and customer service to entertainment. Teams use them to train medical staff, power voice assistants, test call centre flows, or support people who’ve lost their voice due to illness.\n\nWith the ElevenLabs node in n8n, you can now automate these kinds of voice-powered workflows directly in the editor - without workarounds or custom code. It’s a fast, flexible way to bring speech into the tools and systems you already use.\n\n_\"We wanted developers to be able to build voice-powered workflows without jumping through hoops. The node makes that possible. It’s a clean, fast way to bring speech into automation — whether you’re restoring a voice or just adding sound to something new\"_ says Louise Meyer-Schoenherr, Customer Success, ElevenLabs.\n\n### **Spotlight: SerpApi**\n\n[** _SerpApi_**](https://serpapi.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io) aims to build the best APIs in the world for all the top search engines, enabling users to scrape and parse results as a human would see them on Google, Bing, Baidu, Yahoo, Yandex, Ebay, Google Maps and more.\n\nJust like its core product stack, the SerpApi n8n community node offers the same robust features and includes ready-built integrations for the top 20+ search engines, including Google Search, Shopping, Images, Maps, and News.\n\nThe use cases for the SerpApi community node range from LLM training and building AI chat bots, to monitoring SEO, prices, and competitor reviews. SerpApi Customer Success Engineer Alex Barron even built an AI travel agent.\n\nAlex explained: _“We often help users who can’t write code, but they can think logically and have a vision for what they want to build. Some were already using SerpApi through n8n with the standard HTTP node, but were finding it too complicated. We wanted to build integrations that would make it easier for them to bring their vision to life, and contributing a community node to n8n was the ideal way to help more users across the globe.”_  \n\nWhile SerpApi is launching the community node with their most popular search engine APIs, you can still use their standard HTTP library for other APIs. The team is also always open to user feedback and plans to add support for more features and APIs in the future.\n\n![](https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/05/serp-screenshot-2.png)\n\n### **Spotlight: Brave (coming soon)**\n\n[**_Brave Search_**](https://search.brave.com/?ref=blog.n8n.io) is the world’s most complete, independent, search engine, with a depth of results and ranking quality that rivals Big Tech. The Brave Search API n8n community code is an extension of the Brave Search API, a powerful developer tool for building apps that can programmatically search the web. \n\nThe Brave Search n8n community node provides the most important service level implementations for all major request types, so you can seamlessly request images, news, videos, and websites. Plus, there’s plans in the works to introduce more configurations for even greater precision with queries\n\n“ _As AI use is growing across the web, more and more people are wanting to integrate intelligent   features into their projects. One area that LLMs fall short is real-time data. Leveraging the Brave Search API significantly increases AI effectiveness by grounding LLM responses in context-rich information from the Web. We’re working hard to introduce more ways for developers to build with the power of the web, including expanding the capabilities of our community node in n8n.” _\\- Sampson, Senior Developer Relations at Brave Search \n\nThe possibilities with the node are endless, from fetching localized insights, to completely replicating the way that human users search the web with AI agents. At a recent hackathon, one user leveraged the node to feed real-time data to an NPC. When other players would ask questions, the NPC could respond with live data, discussing topical issues in human speech like the recent papal conclave or newly released movies.\n\n## **Ready to try it?**\n\nWhether you're building workflows or building nodes, here’s how to get started:\n\n### **For users:**\n\nInstance owners can install verified community nodes by opening the editor, heading to the Nodes panel and searching for a node by name. Verified nodes will appear with a checkmark and can be installed with a click. Once installed, verified nodes are available to everyone on the instance - ready to be dragged, dropped, and connected just like any other node in your workflow.\n\n### **For builders:**\n\nAlready built a node or thinking about creating one?**Raise your hand!**\n\nReview the [_guidance_](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/build-community-nodes/?ref=blog.n8n.io) for building, designing, and verifying your node, then [_submit it_](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b?ref=blog.n8n.io) to be considered for onboarding.
