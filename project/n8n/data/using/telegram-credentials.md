# Telegram credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Telegram](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/)
  * [Telegram Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/)



## Prerequisites#

Create a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API bot access token



## Related resources#

Refer to [Telegram's Bot API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for more information about the service.

Refer to the [Telegram Bot Features](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features) documentation for more information on creating and working with bots.

## Using API bot access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A bot **Access Token**



To generate your access token:

  1. Start a chat with the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).
  2. Enter the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
  3. The BotFather will ask you for a name and username for your new bot:
     * The **name** is the bot's name displayed in contact details and elsewhere. You can change the bot name later.
     * The **username** is a short name used in search, mentions, and t.me links. Use these guidelines when creating your username:
       * Must be between 5 and 32 characters long.
       * Not case sensitive.
       * May only include Latin characters, numbers, and underscores.
       * Must end in `bot`, like `tetris_bot` or `TetrisBot`.
       * You can't change the username later.
  4. Copy the bot **token** the BotFather generates and add it as the **Access Token** in n8n.



Refer to the [BotFather Create a new bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#creating-a-new-bot) for more information.
