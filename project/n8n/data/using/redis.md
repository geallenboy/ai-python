# Redis node#

Use the Redis node to automate work in Redis, and integrate Redis with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Redis features, including deleting keys, getting key values, setting key value, and publishing messages to the Redis channel. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Redis node supports and links to more resources.

Credentials

Refer to [Redis credentials](../../credentials/redis/) for guidance on setting up authentication.
