  2. Select **Create an app**.
  3. Enter an **App name** , like `n8n integration`.
  4. Enter an **App description**.
  5. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Redirect URI** in your Spotify app.
  6. Check the box to agree to the Spotify Terms of Service and Branding Guidelines.
  7. Select **Create**. The **App overview** page opens.
  8. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.
  9. Copy the **Client Secret** and enter it in your n8n credential.
  10. Select **Connect my account** and follow the on-screen prompts to finish authorizing the credential.
