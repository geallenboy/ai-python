# TimescaleDB credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [TimescaleDB](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb/)



## Prerequisites#

An available instance of [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/).

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Database connection



## Related resources#

Refer to [Timescale's documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/) for more information about the service.

## Using database connection#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * The **Host** : The fully qualified server name or IP address of your TimescaleDB server.
  * The **Database** : The name of the database to connect to.
  * A **User** : The user name you want to log in with.
  * A **Password** : Enter the password for the database user you are connecting to.
  * **Ignore SSL Issues** : If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails and you won't see the **SSL** selector.
  * **SSL** : This setting controls the `ssl-mode` connection string for the connection. Options include:
    * **Allow** : Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `allow`. First try a non-SSL connection; if that fails, try an SSL connection.
    * **Disable** : Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `disable`. Only try a non-SSL connection.
    * **Require** : Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `require`, which is the default for TimescaleDB connection strings. Only try an SSL connection. If a root CA file is present, verify that a trusted certificate authority (CA) issued the server certificate.
  * **Port** : The port number of the TimescaleDB server.



Refer to [Timescale's connection settings documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/integrations/query-admin/qstudio/#connection-settings) for more information about the non-SSL fields. Refer to [Connect with a stricter SSL](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/security/strict-ssl/) for more information about the SSL options.
