# Zep credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Zep](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryzep/)
  * [Zep Vector Store](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorezep/)



## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key



## Related resources#

Refer to [Zep's Cloud SDK documentation](https://help.getzep.com/sdks) and [Open Source SDK documentation](https://docs.getzep.com/sdk/) for more information about the service. Refer to [Zep's REST API documentation](https://getzep.github.io/zep/) for information about the API.

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Zep server](https://www.getzep.com/) with at least one project and:

  * An **API URL**
  * An **API Key**



Setup depends on whether you're using Zep Cloud or self-hosted Zep Open Source.

### Zep Cloud setup#

Follow these instructions if you're using [Zep Cloud](https://app.getzep.com):

  1. In Zep, open the [**Project Settings**](https://app.getzep.com/projects).
  2. In the **Project Keys** section, select **Add Key**.
  3. Enter a **Key Name** , like `n8n integration`.
  4. Select **Create**.
  5. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n integration as the **API Key**.
  6. Turn on the **Cloud** toggle.



### Self-hosted Zep Open Source setup#

Follow these instructions if you're self-hosting [Zep Open Source](https://docs.getzep.com/deployment/quickstart/):

  1. Enter the JWT token for your Zep server as the **API Key** in n8n.
     * If you haven't generated a JWT token for your Zep server before, refer to Zep's [Configuring Authentication](https://docs.getzep.com/deployment/auth/) for instructions.
  2. Make sure the **Cloud** toggle is off.
  3. Enter the URL for your Zep server as the **API URL**.
