# MailerLite credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [MailerLite](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mailerlite/)
  * [MailerLite Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mailerlitetrigger/)



## Prerequisites#

Create a [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key



## Related resources#

Refer to [MailerLite's API documentation](https://developers.mailerlite.com/docs/) for more information about the service.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An **API Key** : Generate an API key from the **Integrations** menu. Refer to the [API Authentication documentation](https://developers.mailerlite.com/docs/#authentication) for more detailed instructions.



Enable the **Classic API** toggle if the API key is for a MailerLite Classic account instead of the newer MailerLite experience.

Note

Most new MailerLite accounts and all free accounts should disable the **Classic API** toggle. You can find out [which version of MailerLite you are using](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/which-version-of-mailerlite-am-i-using) and learn more about the differences between the two in the [MailerLite FAQ](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/new-mailerlite-faq).
