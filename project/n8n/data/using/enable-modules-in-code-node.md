# Enable modules in Code node

# Enable modules in Code node#

For security reasons, the Code node restricts importing modules. It's possible to lift that restriction for built-in and external modules by setting the following environment variables:

  * `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN`: For built-in modules
  * `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL`: For external modules sourced from n8n/node_modules directory. External module support is disabled when an environment variable isn't set.
