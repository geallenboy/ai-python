# MCP Client Tool node#

The MCP Client Tool node is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) client, allowing you to use the tools exposed by an external MCP server. You can connect the MCP Client Tool node to your models to call external tools with n8n agents.

Credentials

The MCP Client Tool node supports both [Bearer](../../../credentials/httprequest/#using-bearer-auth) and generic [header](../../../credentials/httprequest/#using-header-auth) authentication methods.

## Node parameters#

Configure the node with the following parameters.

  * **SSE Endpoint** : The SSE endpoint for the MCP server you want to connect to.
  * **Authentication** : The authentication method for authentication to your MCP server. The MCP tool supports [bearer](../../../credentials/httprequest/#using-bearer-auth) and generic [header](../../../credentials/httprequest/#using-header-auth) authentication. Select **None** to attempt to connect without authentication.
  * **Tools to Include** : Choose which tools you want to expose to the AI Agent:
    * **All** : Expose all the tools given by the MCP server.
    * **Selected** : Activates a **Tools to Include** parameter where you can select the tools you want to expose to the AI Agent.
    * **All Except** : Activates a **Tools to Exclude** parameter where you can select the tools you want to avoid sharing with the AI Agent. The AI Agent will have access to all MCP server's tools that aren't selected.
