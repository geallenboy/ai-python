File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

n8n uses Git-based source control to support environments. Refer to [Source control and environments](../../../../source-control-environments/setup/) for more information on how to link a Git repository to an n8n instance and configure your source control.
