# Install and manage community nodes#

There are three ways to install community nodes:

  * Within n8n using the [nodes panel](verified-install/) (for verified community nodes only).
  * Within n8n [using the GUI](gui-install/): Use this method to install community nodes from the npm registry.
  * [Manually from the command line](manual-install/): use this method to install community nodes from npm if your n8n instance doesn't support installation through the in-app GUI.



Installing from npm only available on self-hosted instances

Unverified community nodes aren't available on n8n cloud and require [self-hosting](../../../hosting/) n8n.
