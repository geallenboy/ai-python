# Summarization Chain node#

Use the Summarization Chain node to summarize multiple documents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Summarization Chain node, and links to more resources.

## Node parameters#

Choose the type of data you need to summarize in **Data to Summarize**. The data type you choose determines the other node parameters.

  * **Use Node Input (JSON)** and **Use Node Input (Binary)** : summarize the data coming into the node from the workflow. 
    * You can configure the **Chunking Strategy** : choose what strategy to use to define the data chunk sizes.
      * If you choose **Simple (Define Below)** you can then set **Characters Per Chunk** and **Chunk Overlap (Characters)**.
      * Choose **Advanced** if you want to connect a splitter sub-node that provides more configuration options.
  * **Use Document Loader** : summarize data provided by a document loader sub-node.



## Node Options#

You can configure the summarization method and prompts. Select **Add Option** > **Summarization Method and Prompts**.

Options in **Summarization Method** :

  * **Map Reduce** : this is the recommended option. Learn more about [Map Reduce](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/map_reduce/) in the LangChain documentation.
  * **Refine** : learn more about [Refine](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/refine/) in the LangChain documentation.
  * **Stuff** : learn more about [Stuff](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff/) in the LangChain documentation.



You can customize the **Individual Summary Prompts** and the **Final Prompt to Combine**. There are examples in the node. You must include the `"{text}"` placeholder.
