# Calendly credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Calendly Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.calendlytrigger/)



Supported Calendly plans

The Calendly Trigger node relies on Calendly webhooks. Calendly only offers access to webhooks in their paid plans.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access token
  * OAuth2



## Related resources#

Refer to [Calendly's API documentation](https://developer.calendly.com/getting-started) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Calendly](https://www.calendly.com/) account and:

  * An API Key or **Personal Access Token**



To get your access token:

  1. Go to the Calendly [**Integrations & apps**](https://calendly.com/integrations) page.
  2. Select [**API & Webhooks**](https://calendly.com/integrations/api_webhooks).
  3. In **Your Personal Access Tokens** , select **Generate new token**.
  4. Enter a **Name** for your access token, like `n8n integration`.
  5. Select **Create token**.
  6. Select **Copy token** and enter it in your n8n credential.



Refer to [Calendly's API authentication documentation](https://developer.calendly.com/how-to-authenticate-with-personal-access-tokens) for more information.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Calendly developer](https://developer.calendly.com) account and:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A **Client Secret**



To get both, create a new OAuth app in Calendly:

  1. Log in to Calendly's developer portal and go to [**My apps**](https://developer.calendly.com/console/apps).
  2. Select **Create new app**.
  3. Enter a **Name of app** , like `n8n integration`.
  4. In **Kind of app** , select **Web**.
  5. In **Environment type** , select the environment that corresponds to your usage, either **Sandbox** or **Production**.
     * Calendly recommends starting with **Sandbox** for development and creating a second application for **Production** when you're ready to go live.
  6. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and enter it as a **Redirect URI** in the OAuth app.
  7. Select **Save & Continue**. The app details display.
  8. Copy the **Client ID** and enter this as your n8n **Client ID**.
  9. Copy the **Client secret** and enter this as your n8n **Client Secret**.
  10. Select **Connect my account** in n8n and follow the on-screen prompts to finish authorizing the credential.
