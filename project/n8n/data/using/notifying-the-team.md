# 6\. Notifying the Team#

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to send messages to a Discord channel using the [Discord node](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/). After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.6.json)

Now that you have a calculated summary of the booked orders, you need to notify Nathan's team in their Discord channel. For this workflow, you will send messages to the [n8n server](https://discord.gg/G98WXzsjky) on Discord.

Before you begin the steps below, use the link above to connect to the n8n server on Discord. Be sure you can access the `#course-level-1` channel.

Communication app nodes

You can replace the Discord node with another communication app. For example, n8n also has nodes for [Slack](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/) and [Mattermost](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/).

In your workflow, add a Discord node connected to the Code node.

When you search for the Discord node, look for **Message Actions** and select **Send a message** to add the node.

In the Discord node window, configure these parameters:

  * **Connection Type** : Select **Webhook**.
  * **Credential for Discord Webhook** : Select **\- Create New Credential -**.
    * Copy the **Webhook URL** from the email you received when you signed up for this course and paste it into the **Webhook URL** field of the credentials.
    * Select **Save** and then close the credentials dialog.
  * **Operation** : Select **Send a Message**.
  * **Message** :
    * Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the Message field.
    * Copy the text below and paste it into the **Expression** window, or construct it manually using the **Expression Editor**.

          This week we've {{$json["totalBooked"]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json["bookedSum"]}}. My Unique ID: {{ $('HTTP Request').params["headerParameters"]["parameters"][0]["value"] }}

Now select **Test step** in the Discord node. If all works well, you should see this output in n8n:

And your message should appear in the Discord channel #course-level-1:

## What's next?#

**Nathan üôã** : Incredible, you've saved me hours of tedious work already! Now I can execute this workflow when I need it. I just need to remember to run it every Monday morning at 9 AM.

**You üë©‚Äçüîß** : Don't worry about that, you can actually schedule the workflow to run on a specific day, time, or interval. I'll set this up in the next step.
