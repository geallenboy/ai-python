# Zabbix credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate when using the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to make a [Custom API call](../../../custom-operations/).

## Prerequisites#

Create a [Zabbix Cloud](https://www.zabbix.com/) account or self-host your own Zabbix server.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key



## Related resources#

Refer to [Zabbix's API documentation](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/api) for more information about the service.

This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/zabbix/) on n8n's website.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * an **API Token** : An API key for your Zabbix user.
  * the **URL** : The URL of your Zabbix server. Don't include `/zabbix` as part of the URL.



Refer to [Zabbix's API documentation](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/api#authentication) for more information about authenticating to the service.
