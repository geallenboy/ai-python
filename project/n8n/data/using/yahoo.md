# Yahoo Send Email credentials#

Follow these steps to configure the Send Email credentials with a Yahoo account.

## Prerequisites#

To follow these instructions, you must first generate an app password:

  1. Log in to your Yahoo account [Security page](https://login.yahoo.com/account/security).
  2. Select **Generate app password** or **Generate and manage app passwords**.
  3. Select **Get Started**.
  4. Enter an **App name** for your new app password, like `n8n credential`.
  5. Select **Generate password**.
  6. Copy the generated app password. You'll use this in your n8n credential.



Refer to Yahoo's [Generate and manage 3rd-party app passwords](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/generate-manage-third-party-passwords-sln15241.html) for more information.

## Set up the credential#

To configure the Send Email credential to use Yahoo Mail:

  1. Enter your Yahoo email address as the **User**.
  2. Enter the app password you generated above as the **Password**.
  3. Enter `smtp.mail.yahoo.com` as the **Host**.
  4. For the **Port** :
     * Keep the default `465` for SSL or if you're unsure what to use.
     * Enter `587` for TLS.
  5. Turn on the **SSL/TLS** toggle.



Refer to [IMAP server settings for Yahoo Mail](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/sln4075.html) for more information. If the settings above don't work for you, check with your email administrator.
