# Source control and environments#

Feature availability

  * Available on Enterprise.
  * You need to be an n8n instance owner, admin, or project owner to set up source control, and to send work to and from Git.



n8n uses Git-based source control to support environments. Linking your n8n instances to a Git repository lets you create multiple n8n environments, backed by Git branches.
