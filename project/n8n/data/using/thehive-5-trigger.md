# TheHive 5 Trigger node#

Use the TheHive 5 Trigger node to respond to events in [TheHive](https://strangebee.com/thehive/) and integrate TheHive with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of TheHive events, including alerts, cases, comments, pages, and tasks.

On this page, you'll find a list of events the TheHive5 Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.

TheHive and TheHive 5

n8n provides two nodes for TheHive. Use this node (TheHive 5 Trigger) if you want to use TheHive's version 5 API. If you want to use version 3 or 4, use [TheHive Trigger](../n8n-nodes-base.thehivetrigger/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [TheHive 5 Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/thehive-5-trigger/) page.
