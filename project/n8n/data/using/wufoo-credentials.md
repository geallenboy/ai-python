# Wufoo credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Wufoo Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wufootrigger/)



## Prerequisites#

Create a [Wufoo](https://wufoo.com) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key



## Related resources#

Refer to [Wufoo's API documentation](https://wufoo.github.io/docs/) for more information about the service.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An **API Key** : Get your API key from the [Wufoo Form Manager](https://app.wufoo.com/#/form-manager). To the right of a form, select **More > API Information**. Refer to [Using API Information and Webhooks](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/integrations/wufoo-api/) for more information.
  * A **Subdomain** : Your subdomain is the part of your Wufoo URL that comes after `https://` and before `wufoo.com`. So if the full domain is `https://n8n.wufoo.com`, the subdomain is `n8n`. Admins can view the subdomain in the [**Account Manager**](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/account-manager). Refer to [Your Subdomain](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/account/your-subdomain/) for more information.
