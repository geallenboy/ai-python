## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Motorhead](https://www.metal.ai/) account and:

  * Your **Host** URL
  * An **API Key**
  * A **Client ID**



To set it up, you'll generate an API key:

  1. If you're self-hosting Motorhead, update the **Host** URL to match your Motorhead URL.
  2. In Motorhead, go to [**Settings > Organization**](https://app.getmetal.io/settings/organization).
  3. In the **API Keys** section, select **Create**.
  4. Enter a **Name** for your API Key, like `n8n integration`.
  5. Select **Generate**.
  6. Copy the **apiKey** and enter it in your n8n credential.
  7. Return to the API key list.
  8. Copy the **clientID** for the key and enter it as the **Client ID** in your n8n credential.



Refer to [Generate an API key](https://docs.getmetal.io/guides/misc-get-keys) for more information.
