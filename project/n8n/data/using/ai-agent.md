# AI Agent node#

An [AI agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) is an autonomous system that receives data, makes rational decisions, and acts within its environment to achieve specific goals. The AI agent's environment is everything the agent can access that isn't the agent itself. This agent uses external [tools](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task. 

Connect a tool

You must connect at least one tool [sub-node](../../sub-nodes/) to an AI Agent node.

Agent type

Prior to version 1.82.0, the AI Agent had a setting for working as different agent types. This has now been removed and all AI Agent nodes work as a `Tools Agent` which was the recommended and most frequently used setting. If you're working with older versions of the AI Agent in workflows or templates, as long as they were set to 'Tools Agent', they should continue to behave as intended with the updated node.
