# MongoDB credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [MongoDB](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mongodb/)
  * [MongoDB Atlas Vector Store](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoremongodbatlas/)
  * [MongoDB Chat Memory](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymongochat/)



## Prerequisites#

  * Create a user account with the appropriate permissions on a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) server.
  * As a Project Owner, add all the [n8n IP addresses](../../../../manage-cloud/cloud-ip/) to the IP Access List Entries in the project's **Network Access**. Refer to [Add IP Access List entries](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/ip-access-list/#add-ip-access-list-entries) for detailed instructions.



If you are setting up MongoDB from scratch, create a cluster and a database. Refer to the [MongoDB Atlas documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/) for more detailed instructions on these steps.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Database connection - Connection string
  * Database connection - Values



## Related resources#

Refer to the [MongoDBs Atlas documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/) for more information about the service.

## Using database connection - Connection string#

To configure this credential, you'll need the Prerequisites listed above. Then:

  1. Select **Connection String** as the **Configuration Type**.
  2. Enter your MongoDB **Connection String**. To get your connection string in MongoDB, go to **Database > Connect**.
     1. Select **Drivers**.
     2. Copy the code you see in **Add your connection string into your application code**. It will be something like: `mongodb+srv://yourName:yourPassword@clusterName.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`.
     3. Replace the `<password>` and `<username>` in the connection string with the database user's credentials you'll be using.
     4. Enter that connection string into n8n.
     5. Refer to [Connection String](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/) for information on finding and formatting your connection string.
  3. Enter your **Database** name. This is the name of the database that the user whose details you added to the connection string is logging into.
  4. Select whether to **Use TLS** : Turn on to use TLS. You must have your MongoDB database configured to use TLS and have an x.509 certificate generated. Add information for these certificate fields in n8n:
     * **CA Certificate**
     * **Public Client Certificate**
     * **Private Client Key**
     * **Passphrase**



Refer to [MongoDB's x.509 documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-x.509/#std-label-client-x509-certificates-requirements) for more information on working with x.509 certificates.

## Using database connection - Values#

To configure this credential, you'll need the Prerequisites listed above. Then:

  1. Select **Values** as the **Configuration Type**.
  2. Enter the database **Host** name or address.
  3. Enter the **Database** name.
  4. Enter the **User** you'd like to log in as.
  5. Enter the user's **Password**.
  6. Enter the **Port** to connect over. This is the port number your server uses to listen for incoming connections.
  7. Select whether to **Use TLS** : Turn on to use TLS. You must have your MongoDB database configured to use TLS and have an x.509 certificate generated. Add information for these certificate fields in n8n:
     * **CA Certificate**
     * **Public Client Certificate**
     * **Private Client Key**
     * **Passphrase**



Refer to [MongoDB's x.509 documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-x.509/#std-label-client-x509-certificates-requirements) for more information on working with x.509 certificates.
