# Todoist credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Todoist](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.todoist/)



## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key
  * OAuth2



## Related resources#

Refer to [Todoist's REST API documentation](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#overview) for more information about the service.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) account and:

  * An **API Key**



To get your **API Key** :

  1. In Todoist, open your [**Integration settings**](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations).
  2. Select the **Developer** tab.
  3. Copy your **API token** and enter it as the **API Key** in your n8n credential.



Refer to [Find your API token](https://todoist.com/help/articles/find-your-api-token-Jpzx9IIlB) for more information.

## Using OAuth2#

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need a [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) account and:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A **Client Secret**



Get both by creating an application:

  1. Open the Todoist [App Management Console](https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html).
  2. Select **Create a new app**.
  3. Enter an **App name** for your app, like `n8n integration`.
  4. Select **Create app**.
  5. Copy the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** and enter it as the **OAuth redirect URL** in Todoist.
  6. Copy the **Client ID** from Todoist and enter it in your n8n credential.
  7. Copy the **Client Secret** from Todoist and enter it in your n8n credential.
  8. Configure the rest of your Todoist app as it makes sense for your use case.
