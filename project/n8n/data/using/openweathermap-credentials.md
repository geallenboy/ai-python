You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [OpenWeatherMap](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.openweathermap/)



## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access token



## Related resources#

Refer to [OpenWeatherMap's API documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need an [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) account and:

  * An **Access Token**



To get your **Access Token** :

  1. After you verify your email address, OpenWeatherMap includes an **API Key** in your welcome email.
  2. Copy that key and enter it in your n8n credential.



If you'd prefer to create a new key:

  1. To create a new key, go to **Account >** [**API Keys**](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).
  2. In the **Create Key** section, enter an **API Key Name** , like `n8n integration`.
  3. Select **Generate** to generate your key.
  4. Copy the generated key and enter it in your n8n credential.
