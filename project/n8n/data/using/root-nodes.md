# Root nodes#

Root nodes are the foundational nodes within a group of cluster nodes.

[Cluster nodes](../../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

  * **completion** : Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
  * **hallucinations** : Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
  * **vector database** : A vector database stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.
