## Related resources#

Refer to [Microsoft Entra ID's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/identity-network-access-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) for more information about the service.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported#

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node: 

  1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
  2. Select the service you want to connect to.
  3. Select your credential.



Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the Microsoft Entra ID node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Updating the Allow External Senders and Auto Subscribe New Members options fails#

You can't update the **Allow External Senders** and **Auto Subscribe New Members** options directly after creating a new group. You must wait after creating a group before you can change the values of these options.

When designing workflows that use multiple Microsoft Entra ID nodes to first create groups and then update these options, add a [Wait](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node between the two operations. A Wait node configured to pause for at least two seconds allows time for the group to fully initialize. After the wait, the update operation can complete without erroring.
