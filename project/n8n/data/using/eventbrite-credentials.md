## Prerequisites#

Create an [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API private key
  * OAuth2



## Related resources#

Refer to [Eventbrite's API documentation](https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api) for more information about the service.

## Using API private key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Private Key** : Refer to the [Eventbrite API Authentication Get a Private Token documentation](https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api#/introduction/authentication/1.-get-a-private-token) for detailed steps to generate a Private Token. Use this private token as the **Private Key** in the n8n credential.



## Using OAuth2#

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch or need more detail on what's happening in the OAuth web flow, refer to the instructions in the [Eventbrite API authentication For App Partners documentation](https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api#/introduction/authentication/2.-\(for-app-partners\)-authorize-your-users) to set up OAuth.
