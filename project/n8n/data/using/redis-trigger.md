# Redis Trigger node#

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.

Use the Redis Trigger node to subscribe to a Redis channel. The workflow starts whenever the channel receives a new message.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/redis/).
