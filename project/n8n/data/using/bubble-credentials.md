Refer to [Bubble's API documentation](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/integrations/api) for more information about the service.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need a paid [Bubble](https://bubble.io) account and:

  * An **API Token**
  * An **App Name**
  * Your **Domain** , if you're using a custom domain



To set it up, you'll need to create an app:

  1. Go to the [**Apps**](https://bubble.io/home/apps) page in Bubble.
  2. Select **Create an app**.
  3. Enter a **Name** for your app, like `n8n-integration`.
  4. Select **Get started**. The app's details open.
  5. In the left navigation, select **Settings** (the gear cog icon).
  6. Select the **API** tab.
  7. In the **Public API Endpoints** section, check the box to **Enable Data API**.
  8. The page displays the **Data API root URL** , for example: `https://n8n-integration.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj`.
  9. Copy the part of the URL after `https://` and before `.bubbleapps.io` and enter it in n8n as the **App Name**. In the above example, you'd enter `n8n-integration`.
  10. Select **Generate a new API token**.
  11. Enter an **API Token Label** , like `n8n integration`.
  12. Copy the **Private key** and enter it as the **API Token** in your n8n credential.
     * Refer to [Data API | Authentication](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api/authentication) for more information on generating API tokens.
  13. In n8n, select the **Environment** that best matches your app:
     * Select **Development** for an app that you haven't deployed, accessed at `https://appname.bubbleapps.io/version-test` or `https://www.mydomain.com/version-test`.
     * Select **Live** for an app that you've [deployed](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/deploying-your-app), accessed at `https://appname.bubbleapps.io` or `https://www.mydomain.com`.
  14. In n8n, select your **Hosting** :
     * If you haven't set up a custom domain, select **Bubble Hosting**.
     * If you've set up a [custom domain](https://manual.bubble.io/help-guides/getting-started/navigating-the-bubble-editor/tabs-and-sections/settings-tab/custom-domain-and-dns), select **Self Hosted** and enter your custom **Domain**.
