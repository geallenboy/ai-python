Refer to [Asana's Developer Guides](https://developers.asana.com/docs/overview) for more information about working with the service.

## Using Access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need an [Asana](https://asana.com/) account and:

  * A Personal **Access Token** (PAT)



To get your PAT:

  1. Open the Asana [developer console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps).
  2. In the **Personal access tokens** section, select **Create new token**.
  3. Enter a **Token name** , like `n8n integration`.
  4. Check the box to agree to the **Asana API terms**.
  5. Select **Create token**.
  6. Copy the token and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.



Refer to the [Asana Quick start guide](https://developers.asana.com/docs/quick-start#setup) for more information.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need an [Asana](https://asana.com/) account.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to register an application to set up OAuth:

  1. Open the Asana [developer console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps).
  2. In the **My apps** section, select **Create new app**.
  3. Enter an **App name** for your application, like `n8n integration`.
  4. Select a purpose for your app.
  5. Check the box to agree to the **Asana API terms**.
  6. Select **Create app**. The page opens to the app's **Basic Information**.
  7. Select **OAuth** from the left menu.
  8. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**.
  9. In Asana, select **Add redirect URL** and enter the URL you copied from n8n.
  10. Copy the **Client ID** from Asana and enter it in your n8n credential.
  11. Copy the **Client Secret** from Asana and enter it in your n8n credential.



Refer to the [Asana OAuth register an application documentation](https://developers.asana.com/docs/oauth#register-an-application) for more information.
