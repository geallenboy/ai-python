# Cluster nodes#

[Cluster nodes](../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

## Root nodes#

Each cluster starts with one [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n).

## Sub-nodes#

Each root node can have one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) attached to it.
