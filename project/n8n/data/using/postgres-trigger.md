# Postgres Trigger node#

Use the Postgres Trigger node to respond to events in [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and integrate Postgres with other applications. n8n has built-in support responding to insert, update, and delete events.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/postgres/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Postgres Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/postgres-trigger/) page.

## Events#

You can configure how the node listens for events.

  * Select **Listen and Create Trigger Rule** , then choose the events to listen for:
    * Insert
    * Update
    * Delete
  * Select **Listen to Channel** , then enter a channel name that the node should monitor.
