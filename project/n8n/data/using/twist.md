## What to do if your operation isn't supported#

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node: 

  1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
  2. Select the service you want to connect to.
  3. Select your credential.



Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Get the User ID#

To get the User ID for a user:

  1. Open the **Team** tab.
  2. Select a user's avatar.
  3. Copy the string of characters located after `/u/` in your Twist URL. This string is the User ID. For example, if the URL is `https://twist.com/a/4qw45/people/u/475370` the User ID is `475370`.
