## Trigger configuration#

To configure the trigger with this Object:

  1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).
  2. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/) documentation for more information.
  3. Select **Instagram** as the **Object**.
  4. **Field Names or IDs** : By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
     * **Comments** : Notifies you when anyone comments on an IG Media owned by your app's Instagram user.
     * **Messaging Handover**
     * **Mentions** : Notifies you whenever an Instagram user @mentions an Instagram Business or Creator Account in a comment or caption.
     * **Messages** : Notifies you when anyone messages your app's Instagram user.
     * **Messaging Seen** : Notifies you when someone sees a message sent by your app's Instagram user.
     * **Standby**
     * **Story Insights** : Notifies you one hour after a story expires with metrics describing interactions on a story.
  5. In **Options** , turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.
