# OpenAI node#

Use the OpenAI node to automate work in OpenAI and integrate OpenAI with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of OpenAI features, including creating images and assistants, as well as chatting with models. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the OpenAI node supports and links to more resources.

OpenAI Assistant node

The OpenAI node replaces the OpenAI assistant node from version 1.29.0 on.

Credentials

## Related resources#

Refer to [OpenAI's documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction) for more information about the service.

Refer to [OpenAI's assistants documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works/objects) for more information about how assistants work.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported#

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node: 

  1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
  2. Select the service you want to connect to.
  3. Select your credential.



Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Using tools with OpenAI assistants#

Some operations allow you to connect tools. [Tools](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/) act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.

Select the **Tools** connector to browse the available tools and add them.

Once you add a tool connection, the OpenAI node becomes a [root node](../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), allowing it to form a [cluster node](../../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) with the tools [sub-nodes](../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). See [Node types](../../node-types/#cluster-nodes) for more information on cluster nodes and root nodes.

### Operations that support tool connectors#

  * **Assistant**
    * [**Message an Assistant**](assistant-operations/#message-an-assistant)
  * **Text**
    * [**Message a Model**](text-operations/#message-a-model)
