# Intercom credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Intercom](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.intercom/)



## Prerequisites#

  * Create an [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) developer account.
  * [Create an app](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/authentication/) in your developer hub.



## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key



## Related resources#

Refer to [Intercom's API documentation](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/references/introduction/) for more information about the service.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An **API Key** : Intercom automatically generates an **Access Token** when you [create an app](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/authentication/). Use this **Access Token** as your n8n **API Key**. Refer to [How to get your Access Token](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/authentication/#how-to-get-your-access-token) for more detailed instructions.
