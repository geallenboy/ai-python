## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) account and:

  * An **API Key** : Hugging Face calls these API tokens.



To get your API token:

  1. Open your Hugging Face profile and go to the [**Tokens**](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) section.
  2. Copy the token listed there. It should begin with `hf_`.
  3. Enter this API token as your n8n credential **API Key**.



Refer to [Get your API token](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/quicktour#get-your-api-token) for more information.
