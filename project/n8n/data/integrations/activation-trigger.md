# Activation Trigger node#

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered when an event gets fired by n8n or a workflow.

Warning

n8n has deprecated the Activation Trigger node and replaced it with two new nodes: the [n8n Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger/) and the [Workflow Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.workflowtrigger/). For more details, check out the entry in the [breaking changes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#01170) page.

Keep in mind

If you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Activation Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node parameters#

  * Events
    * **Activation** : Run when the workflow gets activated
    * **Start** : Run when n8n starts or restarts
    * **Update** : Run when the workflow gets saved while it's active
