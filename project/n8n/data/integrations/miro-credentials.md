# Miro credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate when using the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to make a [Custom API call](../../../custom-operations/).

## Prerequisites#

Create a [Miro](https://miro.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * OAuth2



## Related resources#

Refer to [Miro's API documentation](https://developers.miro.com/reference/overview) for more information about the service.

This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/miro/) on n8n's website.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Miro](https://miro.com/login/) account and app, as well as:

  * A **Client ID** : Generated when you create a new OAuth2 application.
  * A **Client Secret** : Generated when you create a new OAuth2 application.



Refer to [Miro's API documentation](https://developers.miro.com/reference/overview) for more information about authenticating to the service.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to [create an app](https://developers.miro.com/docs/rest-api-build-your-first-hello-world-app) to configure OAuth2. Refer to [Miro's OAuth documentation](https://developers.miro.com/docs/getting-started-with-oauth) for more information about setting up OAuth2.
