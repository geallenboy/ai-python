# Cloud admin dashboard#

Instance owners can access the admin dashboard to manage their Cloud instance. This is where you can upgrade your n8n version and set the timezone.

## Access the dashboard from the app#

  1. [Log in to n8n](https://app.n8n.cloud/magic-link)
  2. Select **Admin Dashboard**. n8n opens the dashboard.



## Access the dashboard if the app is offline#

If your instance is down, you can still access the admin dashboard. When you log in to the app, n8n will ask you if you want a magic link to access your dashboard. Select **Send magic link** , then check your email for the link.
