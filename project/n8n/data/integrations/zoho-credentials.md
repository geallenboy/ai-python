## Related resources#

Refer to [Zoho's CRM API documentation](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/) for more information about the service.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An **Access Token URL** : Zoho provides region-specific access token URLs. Select the region that best fits your Zoho data center:
    * **AU** : Select this option for Australia data center.
    * **CN** : Select this option for Canada data center.
    * **EU** : Select this option for the European Union data center.
    * **IN** : Select this option for the India data center.
    * **US** : Select this option for the United States data center.



Refer to [Multi DC](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/multi-dc.html) for more information about selecting a data center.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, [register an application](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/protocol/oauth-setup.html) with Zoho.

Use these settings for your application:

  * Select **Server-based Applications** as the **Client Type**.
  * Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it in the Zoho **Authorized Redirect URIs** field.
  * Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the application and enter them in your n8n credential.
