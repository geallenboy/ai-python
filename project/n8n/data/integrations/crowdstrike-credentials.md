# CrowdStrike credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate when using the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to make a [Custom API call](../../../custom-operations/).

## Prerequisites#

Create a [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/) account.

## Authentication methods#

  * OAuth2



## Related resources#

Refer to CrowdStrike's documentation for more information about the service. Their documentation is behind a log in, so you must log in to your account on their website to access the API documentation.

This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/crowdstrike/) on n8n's website.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * The **URL** of your CrowdStrike instance
  * A **Client ID** : Generated by creating a new API Client in Crowdstrike in **Support > API Clients and Keys**.
  * A **Client Secret** : Generated by creating a new API Client in Crowdstrike in **Support > API Clients and Keys**.



A broad outline of the appropriate steps is available publicly at the CrowdStrike blog: [Getting Access to the CrowdStrike API](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/get-access-falcon-apis/). CrowdStrike's full documentation is behind a log in, so you must log in to your account to access the full API documentation.
