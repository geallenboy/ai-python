# Set up source control for environments#

Link a Git repository to an n8n instance and configure your source control.

n8n uses source control to provide environments. Refer to [Environments in n8n](../understand/environments/) for more information.

## Prerequisites#

To use source control with n8n, you need a Git repository that allows SSH access. 

This document assumes you are familiar with Git and your Git provider.

## Step 1: Set up your repository and branches#

For a new setup:

  1. Create a new repository for use with n8n. 
  2. Create the branches you need. For example, if you plan to have different environments for test and production, set up a branch for each.



To help decide what branches you need for your use case, refer to [Branch patterns](../understand/patterns/).

## Step 2: Configure Git in n8n#

  1. Go to **Settings** > **Environments**.
  2. In **Git repository URL** enter the SSH URL for your repository.
  3. n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select **RSA** under **SSH Key** if your git host requires RSA.
  4. Copy the SSH key.



## Step 3: Set up a deploy key#

Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access. 

The steps depend on your Git provider. Help links for common providers:

  * [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys)
  * [GitLab | Deploy keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_keys/)



## Step 4: Connect n8n and configure your instance#

  1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.
  2. Under **Instance settings** , choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance.
  3. **Optional** : select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance. This is useful for protecting production instances.
  4. **Optional** : choose a custom color for the instance. This will appear in the menu next to the source control push and pull buttons. It helps users know which instance they're in.
  5. Select **Save settings**.
