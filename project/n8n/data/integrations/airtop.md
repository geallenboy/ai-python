You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

## Node reference#

### Create a session and window#

Create an Airtop browser session to get a **Session ID** , then use it to create a new browser window. After this, you can use any extraction or interaction operation.

### Extract content#

Extract content from a web browser using these operations:

  * **Query page** : Extract information from the current window.
  * **Query page with pagination** : Extract information from pages with pagination or infinite scrolling.
  * **Smart scrape page** : Get the window content as markdown.



Get JSON responses by using the **JSON Output Schema** parameter in query operations.

### Interacting with pages#

Click, hover, or type on elements by describing the element you want to interact with.

### Terminate a session#

End your session to save resources. Sessions are automatically terminated based on the **Idle Timeout** set in the **Create Session** operation or can be manually terminated using the **Terminate Session** operation.
