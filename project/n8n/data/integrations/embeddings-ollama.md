# Embeddings Ollama node#

Use the Embeddings Ollama node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Ollama node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/ollama/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model to use to generate the embedding. Choose from:
    * [all-minilm](https://ollama.com/library/all-minilm) (384 Dimensions)
    * [nomic-embed-text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text) (768 Dimensions)

  * **completion** : Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
  * **hallucinations** : Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
  * **vector database** : A vector database stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.
