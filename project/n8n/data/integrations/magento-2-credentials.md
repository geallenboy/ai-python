# Magento 2 credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following node:

  * [Magento 2](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.magento2/)



## Prerequisites#

  * Create a [Magento](https://magento.com/) account.
  * Set your store to **Allow OAuth Access Tokens to be used as standalone Bearer tokens**.
    * Go to **Admin > Stores > Configuration > Services > OAuth > Consumer Settings**.
    * Set the **Allow OAuth Access Tokens to be used as standalone Bearer tokens** option to **Yes**.
    * You can also enable this setting from the CLI by running the following command:
          
          1

| 
          
          bin/magento config:set oauth/consumer/enable_integration_as_bearer 1
            
  
---|---  
  



This step is necessary until n8n updates the Magento 2 credentials to use OAuth. Refer to [Integration Tokens](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-token/#integration-tokens) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access token



## Related resources#

Refer to [Magento's API documentation](https://devdocs.magento.com/redoc/2.3/) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Host** : Enter the address of your Magento store.
  * An **Access Token** : Get an access token from the [**Admin Panel**](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/admin.html):
    1. Go to **System > Extensions > Integrations**.
    2. Add a new Integration.
    3. Go to the **API** tab and select the Magento resources you'd like the n8n integration to access.
    4. From the **Integrations** page, **Activate** the new integration.
    5. Select **Allow** to display your access token so you can copy it and enter it in n8n.
