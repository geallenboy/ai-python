# Pipedrive credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Pipedrive](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedrive/)
  * [Pipedrive Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedrivetrigger/)



## Supported authentication methods#

  * API token
  * OAuth2



## Related resources#

Refer to [Pipedrive's developer documentation](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/getting-started) for more information about the service.

## Using API token#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Pipedrive](https://pipedrive.com/) account and:

  * An **API Token**



To get your API token:

  1. Open your [**API Personal Preferences**](https://app.pipedrive.com/settings/api).
  2. Copy **Your personal API token** and enter it in your n8n credential.



If you have multiple companies, you'll need to select the correct company first:

  1. Select your account name and be sure you're viewing the correct company.
  2. Then select **Company Settings**.
  3. Select **Personal Preferences**.
  4. Select the **API** tab.
  5. Copy **Your personal API token** and enter it in your n8n credential.



Refer to [How to find the API token](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/how-to-find-the-api-token) for more information.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Pipedrive developer sandbox account](https://developers.pipedrive.com/) and:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A **Client Secret**



To get both, you'll need to register a new app:

  1. Select your profile name in the upper right corner.
  2. Find the company name of your sandbox account and select **Developer Hub**.

No Developer Hub

If you don't see **Developer Hub** in your account dropdown, sign up for a [developer sandbox account](https://developers.pipedrive.com/).

  3. Select **Create an app**.

  4. Select **Create public app**. The app's **Basic info** tab opens.
  5. Enter an **App name** for your app, like `n8n integration`.
  6. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add it as the app's **Callback URL**.
  7. Select **Save**. The app's **OAuth & access scopes** tab opens.
  8. Turn on appropriate **Scopes** for your app. Refer to Pipedrive node scopes and Pipedrive Trigger node scopes below for more guidance.
  9. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.
  10. Copy the **Client Secret** and enter it in your n8n credential.



Refer to [Registering a public app](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-registering-the-app) for more information.
