# Update self-hosted n8n#

It's important to keep your n8n version up to date. This ensures you get the latest features and fixes.

Some tips when updating:

  * Update frequently: this avoids having to jump multiple versions at once, reducing the risk of a disruptive update. Try to update at least once a month.
  * Check the [Release notes](../../../release-notes/) for breaking changes.
  * Use [Environments](../../../source-control-environments/) to create a test version of your instance. Test the update there first.



For instructions on how to update, refer to the documentation for your installation method:

  * [Installed with npm](../npm/)
  * [Installed with Docker](../docker/)
