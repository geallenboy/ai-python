## Related resources#

Refer to [Twake's documentation](https://doc.twake.app/developers-api/api-reference) for more information about the service.

## Using Cloud API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Workspace Key** : Generated when you install the **n8n** application to your Twake Cloud environment and select **Configure**. Refer to [How to connect n8n to Twake](https://help.twake.app/en/latest/applications/connectors/index.html#how-to-connect-n8n-to-twake) for more detailed instructions.



## Using Server API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Host URL** : The URL of your Twake self-hosted instance.
  * A **Public ID** : Generated when you create an app.
  * A **Private API Key** : Generated when you create an app.



To generate your **Public ID** and **Private API Key** , [create a Twake application](https://doc.twake.app/developers-api/get-started/create-your-first-application): 

  1. Go to **Workspace Settings > Applications and connectors > Access your applications and connectors > Create an application**.
  2. Enter appropriate details.
  3. Once you've created your app, view its **API Details**.
  4. Copy the **Public identifier** and add it as the n8n **Public ID**.
  5. Copy the **Private key** and add it as the n8n **Private API Key**.



Refer to [API settings](https://doc.twake.app/developers-api/get-started/create-your-first-application#id-3.-api-settings) for more information.
