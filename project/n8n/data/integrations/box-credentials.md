You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Box Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.boxtrigger/)



## Prerequisites#

Create a [Box](https://www.box.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * OAuth2



## Related resources#

Refer to [Box's API documentation](https://developer.box.com/reference/) for more information about the service.

## Using OAuth2#

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch or need more detail on what's happening in the OAuth web flow, you'll need to create a Custom App. Refer to the [Box OAuth2 Setup documentation](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/oauth2/oauth2-setup/) for more information.
