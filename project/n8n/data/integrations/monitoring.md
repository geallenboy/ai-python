# Monitoring#

There are three API endpoints you can call to check the status of your instance: `/healthz`, `healthz/readiness`, and `/metrics`.

## healthz and healthz/readiness#

The `/healthz` endpoint returns a standard HTTP status code. 200 indicates the instance is reachable. It doesn't indicate DB status. It's available for both self-hosted and Cloud users.

Access the endpoint:
    
    
    1

| 
    
    
    <your-instance-url>/healthz
      
  
---|---  
  
The `/healthz/readiness` endpoint is similar to the `/healthz` endpoint, but it returns a HTTP status code of 200 if the DB is connected and migrated and therefore the instance is ready to accept traffic.

Access the endpoint:
    
    
    1

| 
    
    
    <your-instance-url>/healthz/readiness
      
  
---|---  
  
## metrics#

The `/metrics` endpoint provides more detailed information about the current status of the instance.

Access the endpoint:
    
    
    1

| 
    
    
    <your-instance-url>/metrics
      
  
---|---  
  
Feature availability

The `/metrics` endpoint isn't available on n8n Cloud.

## Enable metrics and healthz for self-hosted n8n#

The `/metrics` and `/healthz` endpoints are disabled by default. To enable them, configure your n8n instance:
    
    
    1
    2
    3
    4

| 
    
    
    # metrics
    N8N_METRICS=true
    # healthz
    QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE=true
      
  
---|---  
  
Refer to [Configuration methods](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on how to configure your instance using environment variables.
