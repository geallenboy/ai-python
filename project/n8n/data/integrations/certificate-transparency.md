Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Facebook Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/facebook-trigger/) page.

## Trigger configuration#

To configure the trigger with this Object:

  1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).
  2. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/) documentation for more information.
  3. Select **Certificate Transparency** as the **Object**.
  4. **Field Names or IDs** : By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
     * **Certificate** : Notifies you when someone issues a new certificate for your subscribed domains. You'll need to subscribe your domain for certificate alerts.
     * **Phishing** : Notifies you when someone issues a new certificate that may be phishing one of your legitimate subscribed domains.
  5. In **Options** , turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.



For these alerts, you'll need to subscribe your domain to the relevant alerts:

  * Refer to [Certificate Alerts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/certificate-transparency-api#certificate-alerts-subscribing) for Certificate Alerts subscriptions.
  * Refer to [Phishing Alerts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/certificate-transparency-api#phishing-alerts-subscribing) for Phishing Alerts subscriptions.
