# Facebook Trigger node#

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) is a social networking site to connect and share with family and friends online.

Use the Facebook Trigger node to trigger a workflow when events occur in Facebook.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/facebookapp/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Facebook Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/facebook-trigger/) page.

## Objects#

  * [**Ad Account**](ad-account/): Get updates for certain ads changes.
  * [**Application**](application/): Get updates sent to the application.
  * [**Certificate Transparency**](certificate-transparency/): Get updates when new security certificates are generated for your subscribed domains, including new certificates and potential phishing attempts.
  * Activity and events in a [**Group**](group/)
  * [**Instagram**](instagram/): Get updates when someone comments on the Media objects of your app users; @mentions your app users; or when Stories of your app users expire.
  * [**Link**](link/): Get updates about the links for rich previews by an external provider
  * [**Page**](page/) updates
  * [**Permissions**](permissions/): Updates when granting or revoking permissions
  * [**User**](user/) profile updates
  * [**WhatsApp Business Account**](whatsapp/)

Use WhatsApp Trigger

n8n recommends using the [WhatsApp Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.whatsapptrigger/) with the [WhatsApp credentials](../../credentials/whatsapp/) instead of the Facebook Trigger node for these events. The WhatsApp Trigger node has more events to listen to.

  * [**Workplace Security**](workplace-security/)




For each **Object** , use the **Field Names or IDs** dropdown to select more details on what data to receive. Refer to the linked pages for more details.
