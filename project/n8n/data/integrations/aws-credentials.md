## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access key



## Related resources#

Refer to [AWS's Identity and Access Management documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started.html) for more information about the service.

## Using API access key#

To configure this credential, you'll need an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account and:

  * Your AWS **Region**
  * The **Access Key ID** : Generated when you create an access key.
  * The **Secret Access Key** : Generated when you create an access key.



To create an access key and set up the credential:

  1. In your n8n credential, select your AWS **Region**.
  2. Log in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).
  3. In the navigation bar on the upper right, select your user name and then select **Security credentials**.
  4. In the **Access keys** section, select **Create access key**.
  5. On the **Access key best practices & alternatives page**, choose your use case. If it doesn't prompt you to create an access key, select **Other**.
  6. Select **Next**.
  7. Set a **description** tag value for the access key to make it easier to identify, for example `n8n integration`.
  8. Select **Create access key**.
  9. Reveal the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** and enter them in n8n.
  10. To use a **Temporary security credential** , turn that option on and add a **Session token**. Refer to the [AWS Temporary security credential documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) for more information on working with temporary security credentials.
  11. If you use [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) to host n8n, you can establish a connection between your VPC and some apps. Use **Custom Endpoints** to enter relevant custom endpoint(s) for this connection. This setup works with these apps:
     * Rekognition
     * Lambda
     * SNS
     * SES
     * SQS
     * S3



You can also generate access keys through the AWS CLI and AWS API. Refer to the [AWS Managing Access Keys documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) for instructions on generating access keys using these methods.
