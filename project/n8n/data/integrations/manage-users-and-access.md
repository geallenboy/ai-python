# User management#

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance. It includes:

  * Login and password management
  * Adding and removing users
  * Three [account types](account-types/): **Owner** and **Member** (and **Admin** for Pro & Enterprise plans)



Privacy

The user management feature doesn't send personal information, such as email or username, to n8n.

## Setup guides#

This section contains most usage information for user management, and the [Cloud setup guide](cloud-setup/). If you self-host n8n, there are extra steps to configure your n8n instance. Refer to the [Self-hosted guide](../hosting/configuration/user-management-self-hosted/).

This section includes guides to configuring [LDAP](ldap/) and [SAML](saml/) in n8n.
