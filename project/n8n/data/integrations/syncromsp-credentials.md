Select **Custom Permissions** to enter a name for your token and adjust the permissions to match your requirements.
  * Your **Subdomain** : Enter your SyncroMSP subdomain. This is visible in the URL of your SyncroMSP, located between `https://` and `.syncromsp.com`. If your full URL is `https://n8n-instance.syncromsp.com`, you'd enter `n8n-instance` as the subdomain.
