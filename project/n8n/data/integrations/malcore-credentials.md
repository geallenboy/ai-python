# Malcore credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate when using the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to make a [Custom API call](../../../custom-operations/).

## Prerequisites#

Create a [Malcore](https://app.malcore.io/register) account.

## Related resources#

Refer to [Malcore's API documentation](https://malcore.readme.io/reference/) for more information about authenticating with the service.

This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/malcore/) on n8n's website.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An **API Key** : Get an API Key from your **Account > API**.
