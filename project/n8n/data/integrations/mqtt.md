Use the MQTT node to automate work in MQTT, and integrate MQTT with other applications. n8n supports transporting messages with MQTT.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the MQTT node supports and links to more resources.

Credentials

Refer to [MQTT credentials](../../credentials/mqtt/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

This node can be used as an AI tool

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

## Operations#
