Refer to [Line Notify's API documentation](https://notify-bot.line.me/doc/en/) for more information about the service.

## Using Notify OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Line](https://line.me/en/) account and:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A **Client Secret**



To generate both, connect Line with [Line Notify](https://notify-bot.line.me/en/). Then:

  1. Open the Line Notify page to [add a new service](https://notify-bot.line.me/my/services/new).
  2. Enter a **Service name**. This name displays when someone tries to connect to the service.
  3. Enter a **Service description**.
  4. Enter a **Service URL**
  5. Enter your **Company/Enterprise**.
  6. Select your **Country/region**.
  7. Enter your name or team name as the **Representative**.
  8. Enter a valid **Email address**. Line will verify this email address before the service is fully registered. Use an email address you have ready access to.
  9. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from your n8n credential and enter it as the **Callback URL** in Line Notify.
  10. Select **Agree and continue** to agree to the terms of service.
  11. Verify the information you entered is correct and select **Add**.
  12. Check your email and open the Line Notify Registration URL to verify your email address.
  13. Once verification is complete, open [**My services**](https://notify-bot.line.me/my/services/).
  14. Select the service you just added.
  15. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.
  16. Select the option to **Display** the **Client Secret**. Copy the **Client Secret** and enter it in your n8n credential.
  17. In n8n, select **Connect my account** and follow the on-screen prompts to finish the credential.
