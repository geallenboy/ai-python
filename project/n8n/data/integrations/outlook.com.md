# Outlook.com Send Email credentials#

Follow these steps to configure the Send Email credentials with an Outlook.com account.

## Set up the credential#

To configure the Send Email credential to use an Outlook.com account:

  1. Enter your Outlook.com email address as the **User**.
  2. Enter your Outlook.com password as the **Password**.

App password

Outlook.com doesn't require you to use an app password, but if you'd like to for security reasons, refer to Use an app password.

  3. Enter `smtp-mail.outlook.com` as the **Host**.

  4. Enter `587` for the **Port**.
  5. Turn on the **SSL/TLS** toggle.



Refer to Microsoft's [POP, IMAP, and SMTP settings for Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-for-outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040) documentation for more information. If the settings above don't work for you, check with your email administrator.

## Use an app password#

If you'd prefer to use an app password instead of your email account password:

  1. Log into the [My Account](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/) page.
  2. If you have a left navigation option for **Security Info** , jump to Security Info app password. If you don't have an option for **Security Info** , continue with these instructions.
  3. Go to the [Additional security verification page](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/Proofup.aspx).
  4. Select **App passwords** and **Create**.
  5. Enter a **Name** for your app password, like `n8n credential`.
  6. Use the option to **copy password to clipboard** and enter this as the **Password** in n8n instead of your email account password.



Refer to Outlook's [Manage app passwords for 2-step verification](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/manage-app-passwords-for-two-step-verification-d6dc8c6d-4bf7-4851-ad95-6d07799387e9) page for more information.

### Security Info app password#

If you have a left navigation option for **Security Info** :

  1. Select **Security Info**. The Security Info page opens.
  2. Select **\+ Add method**.
  3. On the **Add a method** page, select **App password** and then select **Add**.
  4. Enter a **Name** for your app password, like `n8n credential`.
  5. Copy the **Password** and enter this as the **Password** in n8n instead of your email account password.
