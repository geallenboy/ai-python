# Gong credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Gong](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gong/)



## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access token
  * OAuth2



## Related resources#

Refer to [Gong's API documentation](https://gong.app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Gong](https://app.gong.io/welcome/sign-in) account and:

  * An **Access Key**
  * An **Access Key Secret**



You can create both of these items on the [Gong API Page](https://app.gong.io/company/api) (you must be a technical administrator in Gong to access this resource).

Refer to [Gong's API documentation](https://gong.app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation) for more information about authenticating to the service.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Gong](https://app.gong.io/welcome/sign-in) account, a [Gong developer](https://gong.partnerfleet.app/application_forms/become-a-gong-technology-partner/partner_applications/new) account and:

  * A **Client ID** : Generated when you create an Oauth app for Gong.
  * A **Client Secret** : Generated when you create an Oauth app for Gong.



If you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to [create an app](https://help.gong.io/docs/create-an-app-for-gong) to configure OAuth2. Refer to [Gong's OAuth documentation](https://gong.app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation) for more information about setting up OAuth2.
