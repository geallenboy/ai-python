  * The **API Domain**



To set it up:

  1. Go to **Settings >** [**API**](https://www.jotform.com/myaccount/api).
  2. Select **Create New Key**.
  3. Select the **Name** in JotForm to update the API key name to something meaningful, like `n8n integration`.
  4. Copy the **API Key** and enter it in your n8n credential.
  5. In n8n, select the **API Domain** that applies to you based on the forms you're using:
     * **api.jotform.com** : Use this unless the other form types apply to you.
     * **eu-api.jotform.com** : Select this if you're using JotForm [EU Safe Forms](https://www.jotform.com/eu-safe-forms/).
     * **hipaa-api.jotform.com** : Select this if you're using JotForm [HIPAA forms](https://www.jotform.com/hipaa/).
