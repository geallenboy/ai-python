# Configure workflow timeouts

# Configure workflow timeout settings#

A workflow times out and gets canceled after this time (in seconds). If the workflow runs in the main process, a soft timeout happens (takes effect after the current node finishes). If a workflow runs in its own process, n8n attempts a soft timeout first, then kills the process after waiting for a fifth of the given timeout duration.

`EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` default is `-1`. For example, if you want to set the timeout to one hour:
    
    
    1

| 
    
    
    export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT=3600
      
  
---|---  
  
You can also set maximum execution time (in seconds) for each workflow individually. For example, if you want to set maximum execution time to two hours:
    
    
    1

| 
    
    
    export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX=7200
      
  
---|---  
  
Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/executions/) for more information on these variables.
