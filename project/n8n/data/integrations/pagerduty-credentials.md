# PagerDuty credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [PagerDuty](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pagerduty/)



## Prerequisites#

Create a [PagerDuty](https://pagerduty.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API token
  * OAuth2



## Related resources#

Refer to [PagerDuty's API documentation](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/531092d4c6658-rest-api-v2-overview) for more information about the service.

## Using API token#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A general access **API Token** : To generate an API token, go to **Integrations > Developer Tools > API Access Keys > Create New API Key**. Refer to [Generate a General Access REST API key](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-general-access-rest-api-key) for more information.



## Using OAuth2#

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, [register a new Pagerduty app](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/dd91fbd09a1a1-register-an-app).

Use these settings for registering your app:

  * In the **Category** dropdown list, select **Infrastructure Automation**.
  * In the **Functionality** section, select **OAuth 2.0**.



Once you **Save** your app, open the app details and [edit your app configuration](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/dd91fbd09a1a1-register-an-app#editing-your-app-configuration) to use these settings:

  * Within the **OAuth 2.0** section, select **Add**.
  * Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and paste it into the **Redirect URL** field.
  * Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from PagerDuty and add these to your n8n credentials.
  * Select **Read/Write** from the **Set Permission Scopes** dropdown list.



Refer to the instructions in [App functionality](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/b25fd1b8acb1b-app-functionality) for more information on available functionality. Refer to the PagerDuty [OAuth Functionality documentation](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/f59fdbd94ceab-o-auth-functionality) for more information on the OAuth flow.
