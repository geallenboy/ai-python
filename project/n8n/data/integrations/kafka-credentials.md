# Kafka credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Kafka](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.kafka/)
  * [Kafka Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.kafkatrigger/)



## Supported authentication methods#

  * Client ID



## Related resources#

Refer to [Kafka's documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/) for more information about using the service.

If you're new to Kafka, refer to the [Apache Kafka Quickstart](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) for initial setup.

Refer to [Encryption and Authentication using SSL](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_ssl) for working with SSL in Kafka.

## Using client ID#

To configure this credential, you'll need a running Kafka environment and:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A list of relevant **Brokers**
  * Username/password authentication details if your Kafka environment uses authentication



To set it up:

  1. Enter the `CLIENT-ID` of the client or consumer group in the **Client ID** field in your credential.
  2. Enter a comma-separated list of relevant **Brokers** for the credential to use in the format `<broker-service-name>:<port>`. Use the name you gave the broker when you defined it in the `services` list. For example, `kafka-1:9092,kafka-2:9092` would add the brokers `kafka-1` and `kafka-2` on port `9092`.
  3. If your Kafka environment doesn't use SSL, turn off the **SSL** toggle.
  4. If you've enabled authentication using SASL in your Kafka environment, turn on the **Authentication** toggle. Then add:
     1. The **Username**
     2. The **Password**
     3. Select the broker's configured **SASL Mechanism**. Refer to [SASL configuration](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_config) for more information. Options include:
        * `Plain`
        * `scram-sha-256`
        * `scram-sha-512`
