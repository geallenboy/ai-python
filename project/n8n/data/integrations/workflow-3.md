# Workflow 3: Monitoring workflow errors#

Last but not least, let's help Nathan know if there are any errors running the workflow.

To accomplish this task, create an Error workflow that monitors the main workflow:

  1. Create a new workflow.
  2. Add an **Error Trigger node** (and execute it as a test).
  3. Connect a **Discord node** to the **Error Trigger node** and configure these fields:  


     * **Webhook URL** : The Discord URL that you received in the email from n8n when you signed up for this course.
     * **Text** : "The workflow `{workflow name}` failed, with the error message: `{execution error message}`. Last node executed: `{name of the last executed node}`. Check this workflow execution here: `{execution URL}` My Unique ID: " followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.

Note that you need to replace the text in curly brackets `{}` with expressions that take the respective information from the Error Trigger node.  


  4. Execute the Discord node.

  5. Set the newly created workflow as the **Error Workflow** for the main workflow you created in the previous lesson.



The workflow should look like this:

Quiz questions

  * What fields does the **Error Trigger node** return?
  * What information about the execution does the **Error Trigger node** return?
  * What information about the workflow does the **Error Trigger node** return?
  * What's the expression to reference the workflow name?
