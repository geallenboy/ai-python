# HighLevel credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [HighLevel node](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.highlevel/)



## Prerequisites#

Create a [HighLevel developer](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key: Use with API v1
  * OAuth2: Use with API v2



API 1.0 deprecation

HighLevel deprecated API v1.0 and no longer maintains it. Use OAuth2 to set up new credentials.

## Related resources#

Refer to [HighLevel's API 2.0 documentation](https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/0443d7d1a4bd0-overview) for more information about the service.

For existing integrations with the API v1.0, refer to [HighLevel's API 1.0 documentation](https://public-api.gohighlevel.com/).

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An **API Key** : Refer to the [HighLevel API 1.0 Welcome documentation](https://public-api.gohighlevel.com/) for instructions on getting your API key.



## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A **Client Secret**



To generate both, create an app in **My Apps > Create App**. Use these settings:

  1. Set **Distribution Type** to **Sub-Account**.
  2. Add these **Scopes** :
     * `locations.readonly`
     * `contacts.readonly`
     * `contacts.write`
     * `opportunities.readonly`
     * `opportunities.write`
     * `users.readonly`
  3. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add it as a **Redirect URL** in your HighLevel app.
  4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from HighLevel and add them to your n8n credential.
  5. Add the same scopes added above to your n8n credential in a space-separated list. For example:

`locations.readonly contacts.readonly contacts.write opportunities.readonly opportunities.write users.readonly`
