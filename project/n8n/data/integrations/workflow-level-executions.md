# Workflow-level executions list#

The **Executions** list in a workflow shows all executions for that workflow.

Deleted workflows

When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.

Execution history and workflow history

Don't confuse the execution list with [Workflow history](../../history/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](../debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.

## View executions for a single workflow#

In the workflow, select the **Executions** tab in the top menu. You can preview all executions of that workflow.

## Filter executions#

You can filter the executions list.

  1. In your workflow, select **Executions**. 
  2. Select **Filters**.
  3. Enter your filters. You can filter by:
     * **Status** : choose from **Failed** , **Running** , **Success** , or **Waiting**.
     * **Execution start** : see executions that started in the given time.
     * **Saved custom data** : this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to [Custom executions data](../custom-executions-data/) for information on adding custom data.

Feature availability

Custom executions data is available on:

       * Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
       * Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

Available in version 0.222.0 and above.




## Retry failed workflows#

If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:

  1. Open the **Executions** list.
  2. For the workflow execution you want to retry, select **Refresh** ![Refresh icon](../../../_images/common-icons/refresh.png).
  3. Select either of the following options to retry the execution:
     * **Retry with currently saved workflow** : Once you make changes to your workflow, you can select this option to execute the workflow with the previous execution data.
     * **Retry with original workflow** : If you want to retry the execution without making changes to your workflow, you can select this option to retry the execution with the previous execution data.
