  "readme": "This is a workflow that tries to answer user queries using the standard GPT-4 model. If it can't answer, it sends a message to Slack to ask for human help. It prompts the user to supply an email address.\n\nThis workflow is used in [Advanced AI examples | Ask a human](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/human-fallback/) in the documentation.\n\nTo use this workflow:\n\n  1. Load it into your n8n instance.\n  2. Add your credentials as prompted by the notes.\n  3. Configure the Slack node to use your Slack details, or swap out Slack for a different service.\n\n\n",
