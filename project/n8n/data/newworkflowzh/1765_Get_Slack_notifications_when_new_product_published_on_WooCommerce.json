Listen for WooCommerce product creation\n  2. If permalink starts with https://[your-url-here].com/product/\n  3. Slack bot notifies channel that a new product has been added.\n\n\n\nPlease note, you must update the URL in the IF node to match your url. If your WooCommerce doesn't use the slug /product/, that will need to be updated too.\n",
