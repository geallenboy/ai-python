  "readme": "**Task:**  \nMerge two datasets into one based on matching rules\n\n**Why:**  \nA powerful capability of n8n is to easily branch out the workflow in order to process different datasets. Even more powerful is the ability to join them back together with SQL-like joining logic.\n\n**Main use cases:**\n\n  * Appending data sets\n  * Keep only new items\n  * Keep only existing items\n\n\n",
