Since all my expenses are digital, I just extract the transactions from bank PDF statements and screenshots into CSV to import into my budgeting software.\n\n[Read more -> How I used A.I. to track all my expenses](https://rumjahn.com/how-to-extract-pdf-and-image-text-into-csv-using-n8n-without-manual-data-entry/)\n\n# What this workflow does\n\n  * Upload your PDF or screenshots into Google Drive\n  * It then passes the PDF/image to Vertex Gemini to do some A.I. image recognition\n  * It then sends the transactions as CSV and stores it into another Google Drive folder\n\n\n\n# Setup\n\n  1. Set up 2 google drive folders. 1 for uploading and 1 for the output.\n  2. Input your Google Drive crendtials\n  3. Input your Vertex Gemini credentials\n\n\n\n# How to adjust it to your needs\n\n  * You can upload other types of documents for information extraction.\n  * You can extract any text data from any image or PDF\n  * You can adjust the A.I. prompt to do different things\n\n\n",
