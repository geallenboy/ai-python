This workflow allows you to send a message to Mattermost when new data gets added in Google Sheets.\n\nThe Interval node triggers the workflow every 45 minutes. You can modify the timing based on your use case. You can even use the Cron node to trigger the workflow.\n\nIf you wish to fetch new Tweets from Twitter, replace the Google Sheet node with the respective node. Update the Function node accordingly.\n\n![Screenshot of the workflow](https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/n8n-website-images/b965cf8aa1494e6ba985405cea911cda.png)\n",
