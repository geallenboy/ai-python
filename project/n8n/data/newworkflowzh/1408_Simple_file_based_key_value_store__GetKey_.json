In docker look at the data path and create a subfolder `local-files`.  \nSet the correct access rights `chmod 1000.1000 local-files`.\n\nPut the workflow code in a new workflow named `GetKey`.\n\nCreate another workflow with a `function item`:\n    \n    \n    return  {\n      file: '/4711.json', // 4711 should be your workflow id\n      key: 'MyKey',\n      default: 'Optional returned value if key is empty / not exists'\n    }\n    \n\nPipe the `function item` to an `Execution Workflow` that calls the `GetKey` workflow.\n\nIt would be nice if we could get someday a shiny built-in n8n node that does the job. :)\n",
